 urg.at ATTN: Sir/Madam, I know this letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not met physically or even through correspondence. Unfortunately for you, I got your contacts through my personal search via the internet,and because of this and other reason I felt it was necessary to contact you today. I am jimmy  Gill, the Bank manager incharge of foreign remittance at the  foreign remittance department of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa.I got your contact through a family friend who works with Embassy of  benin and I from home. I have decided to contact you based on the fact that we have  in our custody in our bankgold sovereign fundsthat are presently being banked by a  foreign account holder who died along with his entire family through plane crash disaster since few years ago. The owner of this account is Mr. Charles Ishigbe. He died on 12th January, 1995. Since I got your contact, I have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his  money because we cannot release it unless someoneapplied for it as next of kin or relation  to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.  However,  the banking law and guideline here in Burkina-faso  stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after a period of (4)three years,it will be  transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The customer Mr. Charles Ishigbe  was one of the prime offenders here and I have been advising the bank to release  the money to his heirs since he is still a foreigner and the holder of  foreign account, he is not entitled to this privilege. The need for assistance and the business opportunity it represents in  terms of investment opportunities are such that I am willing to offer you 10% of the money for your  assistance in transferring this money to your account as compensation for your assistance. Do not be alarmed and beleave this business as you are not legally supposed to  handle this money and I will provide all necessary information that will facilitate  the transfer to your account. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the money while 70% will be for me and my family ; please, if you are  willing to assist us, contact me immediately via email for more details on how we can execute  this transaction. Please, always treat this matter with utmost confidentiality and  secrecy. Indicating your highest regard for the  success of this transaction.Yours faithfully, jimmy  Gill. Monash Bank.

Title: Greetings
 Greetings Greetings Dear Sir/ Madam There is a foreign, an account opened in the bank in london in the year 2000, for the filing of claim,and account is owned by my late father. He entrusted the management of this account with my late father, to whom he gave away large sums of money. We used to live on this money as inheritance. My late father gave me this information about the account when he died. He deposited the sum of forty-eight million five hundred thousand united state bills in the account. I want to ask for your personal assistance to make this happen, if you can be helpful to me, for the benefit of all parties. I deposited this money in the account to avoid the account holder from knowing that we were on the process of claiming the money when they deposited the money. The management  agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as the account owner, and 70% for us. I want you to act as the account owner of the account so that the money will be legally claimable by you as the beneficiary of the money when it is actually deposited in the account. I have two options for you, firstly you can select from among the available bank account in the bank where you will transfer this money, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper sharing of the fund between us. Whichever the option you wish, feel free to forward to me your full name and address so that I can forward the contact of the bank where you wish the deposit made and also include your direct telephone and fax number for easy and safe communication. Please be informed that a very important person in the bank, who did not want to be named, gave me the commission papers from which you are getting this fund and instructed me to get in touch with you as soon as possible with instructions to come over to your country to start investing, soon as I get your positive response. Please always be very confident of your own abilities, whenever you get this fund I will send you the details of the account which you will use to nominate another bank account for this money to be deposited into. Best regards, Mrs. Maryam Abacha Reply To This Email: mariamabacha@yahoo.com

It is such a pleasure to meet a person that is so down to earth.  I really can't begin to express how appreciative I am that you thought to mention this to her.

I have here my cell phone number where I can be reached 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  I can also be reached at this home number 713-853-2821.

I want to say ""Hello"" to you, but I'm afraid that I'll offend her.  Please don't let me get the feeling that I'm not welcome in your home town.  If she's not feeling at home, she can always email you.  Home is where the heart is, and she's happy to show you the door to anyone she thinks might be a threat.

Yours in kind, Yael DeLa Cruz

 From: Dr.L.M.Shongo The head of special operations section in the prime bank here in South Africa, I got your contact through my corporatist e-mail. I asked you to forward to me your private fax number for easy and urgent communication. On further investigation, I discovered that you were one of the victims of unspeakable crimes committed by the ungrateful Government of Nelson Mandela. Although his government has been unable to prevent the release of the fugitives, the owner of this account is Mr. Nkomo Advocu, a citizen of Angola, who ran afoul of the law by continuing to operate accounts after his safe custody expired. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that you were the victim of unspeakable crime, which should be subject to arrest and investigation immediately by the law enforcement agencies concerned. It is only a foreigner who can handle such a transaction and he has strongly advised that his account be booked immediately so as to avoid any breach of the law. I agree that our shares in the total sum of US$18,700,000.00 will be shared in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you. Note that my share is US$50,000,000.00 and Ethil Shongo's is US$50,000,000.00; All necessary arrangement has been made for the transfer, all necessary documents have been made available to me and a decision taken to execute this agreement with you right away. So if you are willing and interested to assist, kindly get back to me by my e-mail box.Please be assured that I will be very grateful if you can come forward to make this claim. With my influence and the position of the bank director, we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing. Please, be rest assured that I will be expecting your urgent response and if you accept to help, I will furnish you with more details of this transaction. Please, note that the reserve bank here in South Africa does not issue foreign bank account for this type of transaction and this is the reason why you come to my country to set up a deposit for this money.  If you are interested, kindly get back to me by my e-mail: msmoso@mail2world.com  Would be grateful if you could give me your public phone and fax numbers for easy communication.

Dr. Shongo,

How are you?  I arrived yesterday late morning from the airport where I was working.  I arrived with the intention of arriving today, but was delayed by the  reason why I was originally supposed to be working Monday, June 16th.  I was originally supposed to fly back today, but was forced to cancel my flight  due to poor weather.

I was originally supposed to have lunch with you on Monday, June 16th, 2001.  However, with the weather being as it was  yesterday, I was forced to postpone that meeting.

I am looking forward to having a  normal lunch today.  I am always happy to meet with you.  Do you have any of the veg at @Seaworld?  I am looking for some examples of what @Seaworld has at @KFC.

He died late last year of heart attack and since then nobody has come up to claim his money.  It was last year that my husband deposited the sum of US$48.500.000/fourty million United State Dollars only in one of the prime bank here in Abidjan, that he intended to use for the purchase of arms and ammunition with the help of some top officials from the government of abidjan.

Title: Re: Re: 

Gerald,

I felt compelled to send you an update regarding the status of our negotiations with respect to your relocation.  I wanted to remind you that we made good progress toward completing your move last August 1.

During that period, we completed the research, analysis, and presentation of your package to the relevant authorities;  finalized your educational requirements;  retained all the relevant financial information; and obtained your financial institution authorization to retain and process your transferred funds.

We made good progress toward completing your move last November when you contacted me about your plans to do so.

Upon learning of the company that you intend to affiliate with, I was in a good mood.  I was optimistic that our group could come to an amicable solution with respect to your relocation.

However, as we move toward completing your move, there seems to be more and more doubt within our group about whether our group can effectively accomplish our objective of having you move to Enron North America.

We feel that we have handled our responsibilities under state and federal anti-kickback statutes, and because we took the appropriate administrative actions, have mitigated the potential for you to face similar concerns.

Additionally, because we greatly appreciate your assistance with respect to your re-entry program, we are hopeful that you will find our group to be helpful in your re-entry into the U.S.

We hope that our efforts to expedite your re-entry and to obtain your immigration stamp have not been unsuccessful; however, we are also hopeful that you will find our group to be helpful in your re-entry into the U.S.

Title: RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL &gt;From the desk of Mr. Joseph Bada. Union Bank Of Nigeria Tugela Branch Lagos, Nigeria. Attn:I got your email address through internet when I was searching for a reliable and trustworthy individual for this important business trusting in your trust and believing in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.      RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL: A British national, Mr. John McKee, an accountant with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC), made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$25,000, 000.00(Twenty-five million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity.  On this deposit, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC), that Mr. John McKee died on an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. John McKee did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of USD$25,000, 000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  So the amount USD$25.1 million.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will ever come forward to claim it.  According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. John McKee so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that it will be immediately after you have been made the next of kin that the bank will start processing the transfer.

Title: BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 BUSINESS PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation, Mr. Jacob N. Fosu, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$19,500,000.00(twenty five million dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Mining Corporation that Mr. Jacob Fosu died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Jacob Fosu had actively opposed the government of ZIMBABWE, and was consequently murdered. It is therefore on this discovery that I now decided to write to you to seek your grateful assistance in transferring the money    to your account to  enable the fund to be put in your account for future use.                                                                                                     This amount $19,500,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is rolling   accruing. We want you to forward this money to your nominated bank account by fax or by email   so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We will employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and also to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will  provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you nominated bank account.                      You should also indicate your contact address and telephone number for easy communication.                          To enable the transfer to move very smoothly, you should also furnish us with your confidential telephone number for easy and safe communication.                          Please, remain patient and help us make this transfer a success.                             Thank you,   JIMBOFOLETTO

Title: URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE
 URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I am Mr.Stefan Obi a merchant in authority Hospital No-9 in the Federal Capital Territory, Freetown,I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, Mr. Charles Ballassi made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$25,000,000.00(Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, the Federal Government of Nigeria that Mr. Charles Ballassi died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Ballassi did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of USD$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the pricipal  FUND at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of  (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Charles Ballassi, so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70%for me and 25% for you and 5% for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction . There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Reply to:stefanobi@myway.com

Title: GOOD DAY
 GOOD DAY FROM MR AMIRI BIRRE. BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER, BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO. Dear Friend, I am MR AMIRI BIRRE, the man Gave you this contact. I got your contact from the internet while I was searching for a reliable person through internet who can assist me in this transaction. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 20 billion US dollars (twenty-five billion USD) in an account that belongs to one of our bank foreign customer who died along with his entire family on (Mar. 15.2001) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after a period of (Ten)two years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 20% of this money will be for you as foreign partner,in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 70% would be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund into you account, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. Your's faithfully, MR AMIRI BIRRE.

I think I know what you need to do to get into your bank account now...

1. Go to your bank and click on the small yellow triangle in the upper left hand corner.  Then find your filing status.  If you are a bank account balance is already transferred...just click on the blue check mark next to ""INCORPORATE"".  If you are not a bank account balance is to be assumed to be 100 cents for every $100 you have already deposited.

2. Verify the information with the closest bank account to your new address.  If you are not sure, just ask.

3. Submit the completed form along with a written confirmation to the PSC.

4. You are now ready to move.  You can either email me with the revised information or call me at 713 853 4659.

I hope this provides you all the information you need to move your money into your account today...

Hi Arun,  This is the email address of the contact who is responsible for handling our immediate family matters.  His name is Bill Kenneker and his phone number is (808) 579-3470.  He is a lawyer and has been in the real estate business for a long time.  He is probably the person best equipped to answer your questions about your family's financial situation.  His name is Ken Norton.  I believe all of our immediate family members have bank accounts at some level and he is probably the one who will be most helpful to you in terms of setting up the bank accounts.  He is a highly educated individual and will be able to answer any questions you have about your family's finances.

He should not be considered an estate agent and should not be relied on as the face of a family-run business.  He is just a regular guy who happens to work for a law firm that represents all of us.

Thanks for your response and please keep me informed on any developments in your family's financial situations.

During the next few weeks, I will begin to contact your immediate family members and find out if there are any changes in their financial situations.  If there are, I will need to send a revised prepared statement to them.  If you are not affected by the change, you should immediately contact him to explain the situation.

He is located in Katy, TX and his phone number is (713) 345-3923.

Sincerely,

Angela Merkel

The Banking law and guideline here in Burkina-faso stipulates that if any bank account  was at the time of the death, the money will be  returned to the bank treasury account  as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next  of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in  respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for  expenses incured in the course of the business and 60 % would  be for me and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country  to dispense the rest of the money. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as  arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the  deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private  telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location  where the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text  of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is risk  free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required information  and necessary documents will be forwarded to you as soon as you reply me back.   Respectfully yours, Mr. Mark Blythe.    E-mail address:markblythe1@hotmail.com

Dear Mrs.Mabel Barry.  My name is Chris Germany.  I work at Enron North America Corp.  in Houston.  My phone number is 713-837-2274.  I have in effect where I work.  I will sub at Enron North America Corp.  on July 1.  That is fine with me.  I will cal you and send you the resume of Ed Merman.   Ed Merman was a partner at Enron North America Corp.  from Jan 1, 2001 to the present.  He had previously worked for Williams & Connolly.  Chris Germany                           from 1984 to the present.  He had previously held various  administrative  positions with the Departments of Energy, Agriculture and Commerce.  He had also spent some time in the private sector.  He was a  manager and chief operating officer of a large transportation company.  He was also a manager and one-time director of several other large companies.  He was highly regarded within his own group. (And rightfully so.)  He will be missed.  But most of all, I'm excited to share  information with you.  This will definitely be a group effort.  I'm sure you will all be joining forces to do this for him.  I'll be continuing my search for a new office in Houston with Ed and will make myself available for a call if you would like to do the same for Williams.   I've asked Jeff Williams to start going over all the new group's procedures with me so that we have a plan in case something should happen.  We will also need to get the accounts signed up on all the new group memberships to make sure that they are getting the correct amount of ""free trade in.""  We will get this all figured out in the next couple of days so we can start the actual shopping.

Once we are all set, it is time to get to the stores.  Amy and I will be heading over there as Project Managers for the newly created Northwest Shoppe, and Brian will be taking care of the Midwest sites.  He will also be taking care of the import/export of the items for our domestic sites. Let me know if you have any questions.  Also, I need to contact David Williams for our gas supply needs.  He is at 713-837-2274 for our gas purchase

Title: I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE
 I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL &gt;From the desk of MRS MAMENAZ SHIRANI, Bank Of AFRICA, Abidjan,Ivory Coast. Attention Please, I am the head of file department in the bank and I got your contact through one of the foreign customers who was robbed of his life by my branch. The name of the victim was ALEXANDRE BRUNU who died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetlinerliner on March 9, 2000 flying from New York to Lome-Togo with the entire passengers on board.  I was informed of his death by the foreign customer who was with me in the bank when I was making the closure of the account. I was sobered by the news and I prayed over it and selected your contact as the person I wanted my bank to contact for this business.  On the transfer of this fund into your account, I sent a routine notification to your private fax number but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his bank that ALEXANDRE BRUNU died in the plane crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000.  So now, when I look for a person to carry out this business deal with, I look for such person abroad who can be trusted and dependable, and also possess the money to cover this transfer.  I was sobered by this news and it's just for this reason that I prayed over it and selected your contact. I am Mrs. AMIN SHIRANI and my son is AMIN SHIRANI. I have a proposition for you. On the date of transfer, 40% of the total amount of $14,000,000.00 will be for you, 60% for me and my family and I and 10 % will be set aside for any expenses that might be incurred in the course of this transaction.  Please, you have to be very careful and zealous in your attitude while you are in this business . I am asking because I don't want this money to go into your account as unclaimed bill.  I don't want this money to go into any account of yours. If you are willing to assist me, contact me so that we will discuss the modalities to see you in your country.  If you receive this email, reply me back. I am waiting for your urgent response.. Thank you. Mrs. AMIN SHIRANI

Dear mariam amin Shirazi, I am at the end of my rope.  I have made several unsuccessful attempts to land the companies EB1194 and PECO.  I have tried all week long and still can't find my way.  The worst part is that I'm not even sure which ones they are anymore.. Does EB1194 now have Enpower as the default?  If not, she needs to know.  Also, I need to be more specific with my payments.  When I make a purchase, am I being given a straight up offer?  Are my payments confirmed?  If not, then I need to talk to the VP of Finance.

Here's what I'm looking for:

1.  Is there any way you can break it down for me please.  Do you have all the wire transfer information for me please?  How are you billing?  When do you start making payments?

2.  Has there ever been a problem with Enpower.  Have you had a chance to speak to Jay Williams?  - Serious inquiries only.

3.  Have you talked to Jay Williams?  - Very Serious inquiries only.

4.  Have you contacted Jay Williams?  - Careful inquiries only.

5.  Have you talked to Pamela Williams?  - Careful inquiries only.

6.  Do you have all the checks/money I need to send to you?  If not, just provide me with a check mark.  Thanks!

Tourist                                                             I am writing this proposal to bring                                    to your notice. I am a man who makes money from illegal   transactions   (under the table) and I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as     unclaimed bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money   remained unclaimed after a period of (3)three years, the money will be transfered    into the bank treasury account as unclaimed fund. The desire of             to transfer this money abroad  has given rise to this whole    business proposal to me. In order to transfer this money to a reliable     foreign account, I am soliciting for your support as follows. You will be entitled to 30% of the   total amount, if you agree to my proposal, as respect to the transfer. Yours truly, jimbrown70

Dear Mr.Malcom Ibrahim.

Thank you very much for your assistance.

I am making slight adjustments in the application to make it as admissible to you as possible(I believe we  have interviewed everyone) .Do you think we should introduce a 60 day hold on new  customers to prevent them from taking advantage of the service  offered by us?

These are just a few of the many small adjustments we are making to the application.

We hope that you will accept our small but significant steps toward providing you with the best possible service.

Many thanks in advance for your continued assistance.

To: Brandon Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: CONFIDENTIAL PROPOSAL.

Let me know if you want to make this more formal.  I have a group of people that would like to get a feel for the energy market before doing any trading.  I would like to do something along the lines of:

1.  Allow persons not connected with us to trade on our books with our  Enron counterpart.

2.  Allow our traders to earn the revenue they need to operate by setting  Rates with our neighboring companies.

3.  Allow us to determine when our time is best to trade.

I would like to be involved in all three of these things for two reasons:

1.  I think we have done well so far.

2.  We think our trading is best suited for a technical person such as myself.  In some cases, this may actually be the case.  Our traders have excelled at managing large numbers of items on a very tight schedule.  With limited inventory, we are able to control our costs effectively and in some cases, we are even able to recoup some of the expense directly.  We are currently operating on a very tight timetable and this has caused some to question our ability to meet the increased volume expectations.  Ultimately, I believe our traders have benefitted the most from the flexibility afforded us by the Enron Agreement.

I hope that what is perceived as a ""slap in the face"" to our traders actually serves as a signal that our traders will be rewarded for managing on a more even playing field.

I do not anticipate there to be many retaliatory transfers of assets nor do I anticipate there to be any market  reaction to the perceived ""handout.""

I hope that those unfamiliar with the details of the previous CAC would be able to contribute to the discussion by providing objective, substantiated evidence to the effect that all parties have been treated fairly.  At the same time, I hope that those who follow the  issue from a corporate perspective will take the time to research the details of the Enron agreement and come to their own conclusions based solely upon that information.

Thank you for your help in this regard.  Given the rapidly changing market conditions surrounding energy companies and markets, it would be unwise to attempt to attempt to prepare a final offer before checking with your company.

 URGENT ASSISTANCE.  Dear friend. I am alice o gola, the manager of bill and exchange at the above mentioned Bank. On June 6, 2000, an America Petroleum Gas Company oil tanker, with full fuel, and on board were some 2,000 metric tons of TNT and other heavy duty explosives. These explosives were destined for Afghanistan as part of President Clinton's 'Operation Iraqi Freedom' contract awarded to America in 2000, but the contract was cancelled. The contract has since been reinstated. The contract was awarded to a foreign company, but the name of the company has not been disclosed. You shall read more news about the contract cancellation on BBC news. Please, if you are not familiar with the web site http://www.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/africa/06/05/algeria.explosives.list/ or http://www.urgent.com/assistance/assistances/ list/ where I got your contact,please get in touch with me. I wish to begin by way of introduction. I am sorry,but this is a business request and one which I feel is very necessary. I want you to direct your sights to: http://www.urgent.com/assistances/list/ Where I got your contact. I hope to hear from you soonest. I have decided to give you 25% of the total sum, 70% for us and 5% for any expenses incurred during the course of this operation. As soon as you indicate your interest, call me to confirm your wish and also to arrange to meet with me in-country for the sharing of the fund according to the percentages indicated. Call me or send me direct e-mail. Yours Faithfully, alice o gola. Algeria.

Dear alice_olga,  The following email message will send an immediate response to your visit to our site.  Your safety is our top priority and we will deal with any outstanding issues informally.  However, we do not anticipate having to deal with these issues in the foreseeable future.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing you with an in-kind contribution to cover some of the shortfalls caused by your out-of-town colleagues.  Many of you have expressed interest in becoming financial supporters of the Agency.   As an added value, we feel it is in your interest to be offered the opportunity to find and develop customers in the local community.  This would be a natural step in that direction.  At the same time, it is in our opinion not to jeopardize any existing prospects by introducing unfamiliar or alternative business models into the mix.  Finally, there is not a great deal that can be done about the imminence of your plans to leave your current employer.  You will most likely find yourself competing head-to-head with others for limited available work.  To put this in perspective, you will most likely find yourself searching for new opportunities only to find that you are leaving your former company.  You may be thinking ""well, that is tough, considering I am currently on the outside looking in"".  To put this into perspective, consider that your former company may have been profitable, but was it a reflection of the work you actually did? Did you actually invest in and maintain the brands you were working to build? Did you actually bring new ideas to the table? Please feel free to contact me if you are unable to accomplish these objectives, and I will gladly assist you in any way that I can.  In addition to providing me with information regarding your company, I am also happy to provide you with some useful pointers regarding your own business.  These include: 1.  When selecting a new company, it is important to determine which of its many assets speak to it. 2.  What aspects of what does your company bring to the table? 3.  Does your company strive to be engaged with people instead of just numbers? 4.  Does your company meet or exceed their expectations? 5.  Does your company ever receive a ""clean bill of health"" from the IRS?  If the previous three items do not answer your questions, it is possible that your company has already paid its fair share of taxes.  If you are not sure, please contact me at 713.853-

To: Amy Crenshaw/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Inside baseball

Amy,

This weekend we had a little party.  I think it was our 50th or something.  Some people are more senior than others.  I wasn't part of it, but somebody must have been.  Anyway, my wife and I decided to take a little vacation.  Well, I was actually supposed to fly to Boston last night but he (or she, I forget) got in trouble with the FAA for having two different boarding passes.  We finally got it all sorted out and booked a round trip for this weekend.

I was supposed to fly in tonight but he (or she, I forget) got in trouble with the SEC rules and they pulled the plug on that whole ""packing heat"" thing.  I think she's becoming a bigger girl these days.

Anyway, I think we are doing alright.  No big deal really.  We just want to be out of there as soon as possible.

Time to get our stuff packed and ready to move...

Amy

 PLEASE GET BACK TO ME Dear friend,  I am Dr.Uzoruddin Abacha,Bank of  Africa, Dakar Senegal,Senegal. I have a new email address  which I will be grateful if you could assist me with.  During our investigations and Accounting  exercise,I discovered a dormant  account in our bank which belonged to one of our foreign banking customers who died with his entire family on the 16th  of December,2000 in plane crash AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN PARIS FRANCE. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his  next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release  it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all  his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I  became convinced of the business opportunity  presented to me by this sad accident,if you are honest then I am sure you will  be able to handle this transaction for us.   Please do not hesitate to contact me at once so that I  will send you more details on how we intend to actualize  this proposal.   Thanks and God bless.

Title: Re: Re: PLEASE GET BACK TO ME

Jason,

Please don't send me another emergency distress call.  Emergency services are  here to assist.  They are mainly interested in  the property damage reports and flood insurance  applications.

We have run one emergency distress call into that agency's number, and that was because the  previous owner of the property  had outstanding insurance  on the house.  The previous owner was out of town and did not send the  paperwork to us.  He also supposedly had other commitments  that kept him away.

I need to know what they are doing about these other people.

Also, can you give me Jason Fried's phone number?  I want to get a verbal confirmation  from him before I send out the confirmation letter.

Thanks!

I am Mr. Peter Sai   from the People's Bank of China, I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.  On June 6, 1999, a gold merchant/contractor with the Yangon Rubber Company, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at 1,000,000,000.00 Union Jack dollars ($1,000,000,000.00) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Yangon Rubber Company that Mr. Phillip Morris died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptian Boeing 747 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it to yourself via the website below:   www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.

Dear Brother in Law,  
 
1. The  reason we are not ready to send the payment is because the  account balance is not established.  Although it may be possible to get this  confirmed when the matter is before the  Landman/Departman, we  do not have the ability to do so at this time.  Also, because this is a rush job, we  will not be able to provide  a date on which we will be able to deposit the funds.  It is anticipated that we will  begin to receive payments  on a pro rata basis beginning  with the $25,000 deficit.  However, because this is a rush job, and we are not  sure of the exact amount that we are actually paying  out, we are  considering filing a Chapter 11 complaint with the  Real Estate Division of the California Attorney General's Office.  This will  allow us to adjust the amount owed on the underlying  accord.  However, because this is a rush job, and we are not  sure of the exact amount that we are actually paying  out, we are  considering filing a Chapter 13 complaint with the Department of Justice to attempt to force  the full amount owed.

John, Allow me to amend the opening sentence of the Farrago.com prospectus.  As you know, we are currently assessing the performance of the company after it completed the collection and remitted the correct portion of the taxes.  We believe that we have made good progress toward achieving the primary objective of the company - to provide a high level of customer service.  We feel that our sales team has improved substantially, both from our perspective as a company and as a group.  We also believe that our sales force has improved substantially. This might be the first time that we have indicated to you that we were planning to reduce your costs, but we felt it was appropriate given the level of service that you have indicated has been provided.  We believe that our efforts have been effective in reducing our overall costs. As mentioned previously, we believe that our cost structure has been in line with that of our major competitors. As such, we were not surprised that our wholesale rate charged by Pepco was different than that of our major competitors.  We were also not surprised that our energy rate charged by Sempra was higher than that of our major competitors.  We were also not surprised that our transportation expense charged by Xcel was higher than that of our major competitors. This might be the first time that we have indicated to you that we were planning to incur additional expense, but we felt it was appropriate given the level of service that you have indicated has been provided.  We are working on increasing your awareness of our company and its products, and our Company Wide Rate Plan has been in place for some time. This might be the first time that you have chosen to call directly to increase your level of comfort. In addition to providing you with a high level of customer service, we feel that our team members have demonstrated exemplary performance on numerous occasions.  We believe that we have provided you with a level of insight into our company that is not available from our management. This might be the first time that you have chosen to call to increase your level of comfort

It is obvious to me that we have been successful.  We have reduced our operating costs significantly, and I am confident that our group will benefit from the lower total number of  units.  I would expect that our group will also benefit from the fact that our sales representatives have been given  very specific instructions on how to deal with the numerous transactions that have occurred during the last several months.  I also, as you point out, our group has been given a very specific  direction regarding the type of product that we are looking to include in the Reunion package.  not just ""Bl"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0631.png			Machine

We have an account opened with this bank in 1997 Believe it or not, but we still have some funds in the account before the account was discovered by the bank. We were obliged to close the account off when the bank discovered that we had made a living. I was forced to close the account because I don't want the account to be used for any illegal thing. The account was used by some people in the government and some rich black farmers in Africa as a farm in which they lodged their earnings. There is a bill in the bank for the payment of which I was the beneficiary. I now seek your permission to have you stand in as the next of kin to the deceased and also the beneficiary of the account, because I am afraid that my present position will not be enough guarantee you enough time to make this claim.

Title: please respond urgently 
 please reply urgently  Dear Friend, I am Mr Michael Naya Sarr, Bank of  South Africa. I have urgent and very confidential business  proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining corporation,  Mr. Frank Williams made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve  calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,  the South Africa Mining corporation that Mr. Frank Williams died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out  that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.  Frank Williams did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,  including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest  accrued from the years of  interest the bank was due to pay me, when I was still the Director in charge of  the bank.  I told my bank directors and senior staff but they were not  interested in the details. I explained to them that it was because  my bank was still in government administration and they would never know of such  money in their bank. They agreed with me when I was recently informed of  this development.  I now seek your permission to have you stand as next of  kin to Mr. Frank Williams so that the fruits of this old man's labor will  not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.   This application will be made to the  bank as a result of the fact that  he is a foreigner and a South African cannot stand as his next of kin  hence the reason for our  intrusion. All I want from you is your honest co-operation to  enable us see this deal through.   Once  you have received this letter, you should contact me on my  email address  michael_sarr20@yahoo.co.uk   Trusting to hear from you immediately.  Yours Faithfully,  Mr Michael Naya Sarar.

Title: From Thompson Umutha
 From Thompson Umutha ATTN:Sir/Madam. I am Mr Thompson Umutha, the Bank Manager in  my branch.I was startled this morning  when I received a call from a British national about doing a business deal with  me.he said he has something to disclose regarding a customer of our bank who died on  Monday, 15th of June, 2000, with his entire family at his bedside. and his  British next of kin died also.As he stated in his letter of deposit, he died with  a sealed bank account in the Royal Bank of  Hong Kong, the Bank has been  expecting his next of kin to come and get his money because he died  as next of kin and subject to the banking rules and guidelines of my country, but unfortunately  all  his supposed next of kin's or relation died alongside with him at the plane  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is because of this problem that I  decided to seek for a foreign  partner in a country of my choice where i will transfer this money and use  it for investment purpose such as real estate management or hotel management,  since this money has no person or company to whom it can be traced  and the person who is to act as next of kin  or beneficiary to the deposit will be responsible for all  expenses  incured during the business. I will be forwarding to you the contact of the foreign  partner who should act as next  of kin to the deceased. PLEASE YOUR CONFIDENTIAL  TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS: 1) YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONER ADDRESS AND  (REFERENCE) FULL NAMES OF  YOUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. 2) YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONER ADDRESS AND  (REFERENCE) FULL NAMES OF  YOUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. 3) HIGH COMMISSIONERS RETURN FORM. 4) YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONER ADDRESS AND  (REFERENCE) FULL NAMES OF  YOUR BUSINESS ASSOCIATES IF YOU ARE NOT AT LEAST 18 YEARS OR OLDER. 5) YOU CANNOT BE A PARTNER OF CRIMES. 6) YOU CANNOT BE A PARTNER OF CRIMES. I AM THE BANK MANAGER IN  MY BANK AND I AM IN THE PLAYING OF HARD CRITICISM BY YOU. PLEASE REPLY ME BACK TO YOU SO THAT I CAN  REPLY BACK TO YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR FULL IDEA OF YOUR COMPENSATION.  BEST REGARDS, Mr Thompson Umutha.

I emailed you about the possibility of waiving our annual  disposable limits and doing it on a per day basis.  I will talk to our cash  staff and figure out what to do with the excess.  

I don't know if you were on the sales floor when they were doing the due diligence, but you probably never heard of the product before.  It sounded like gibberish to me, and I'm sure that none of the people on the sales floor had either seen the video or the dealer  tool.  How were you supposed to find out about this?

Title: WE NEED YOUR HELP.
 WE NEED YOUR HELP. Dear Sir, I wish to sincerely inform you of my desire to transfer to overseas account your unclaimed sum of $36.4 million. I have decided to do this only on behalf of my Bank and also on behalf of my bank as it is the only way i can see to transfer this money out of the country. But I am afraid that I will not be able to do this alone and I need your support as I am about to transfer this money to any account you will nominate. In my earlier correspondence with you, I made it very very clear that this money was kept in a bank account in EUROPE because we do not have any bank account in this part of the world. The amount in the account is $36.4 million dollars. I would have liked to have transferred this money to any account nominated by you but I could not bring myself to do it that way because of my government's tax payer funded budget deficit. I am sorry but I needed your help to make this happen. I will give you 25% of the total money transferred to your account while the balance of the money in the account will be mine. I want you to make arrangements immediately to come over to your country for future sharing of this money according to percentages previously mentioned. If this proposal is acceptable by you, kindly furnish me immediately with your private phone number for easy and safe communication. I will pay all expenses incurred in the course of this transaction, provided that you will not reduce the amount of the transfer for any reason. I have secretly discussed this matter with the Chief Financial Officer of the bank who I must involve in order to have a smooth transfer of this money to any account nominated by you. At the conclusion of this business, you will be entitled to 20% of the amount, 75% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process. Please please, I need your assistance to finalize this transaction with you and to ensure that no mistake is made during the transfer process. I wait for your early response. Yours Faithfully, Martin Sarr Please Reply To This Email sonofmonim@mail2world.com

 First, let me clarify something: I do not think you will be moving to D.C.W.     I do not think you will be transferring to D.C.W. to become a D.C.W. assistant.  I do not have an  Enron cell phone number with me when I send my resume to you.  I do not know what your phone number is at the moment.  If you need to reach me, your best to call me or leave a supervisor at the  message at 561-415-568-447317891.

Title: Re: Re: Your kind attention needed.      

Dear Mr.Chief Solomon,

About four months ago I sent you a convo concerning my thinking about becoming a Deed Collection warden.  As a result of my handling of the situation, I believe I have given
 you an accurate picture of what I think about you and your potential employment
 situation. 

Therefore, I would like to clear up a few things
 regarding my thinking about you and your involvement with the department. 

First, let me clarify something: I do not think you will be moving to  D.C.W. to become a D.C.W. assistant.  I do not think you  will be transferring to D.C.W. to become a D.C.W. director.  I do not think you will be transferring to  A.I.M. to become a full time employee of the Public  Servants.  

Therefore, I would like to clear up a few things
 regarding my thinking about you and your involvement with the department. 

First,  I do not think you will be moving to  D.C.W. to become a D.C.W. assistant.  I do not think you  will be transferring to D.C.W. to become a D.C.W. director.  I do not think you  will be transferring to  Any one of the four services.  I would expect to work under a single head  Officer.  This is not the kind of person  you would want to be associated with.  Also, let me assure you that my co-workers believe  that I am striving to achieve within A.I.M.  the highest level of professional  interaction possible.  I do not see this  Co-Working or other type of arrangement as advantageous  over all else.

Lastly, I wanted to clear up a few things
 Co-Working and similar arrangements are  not for the faint of heart.  It is important to realize that one of the primary purposes of a Co-Working  Organization is to create an environment in which participants can  easily come together for a common purpose, i.e. seminar,  dinner,  a conference room, etc.  In this regard, I can understand  why people might be a bit nervous about Co-Working  and its potential to subvert the intent of the  the Organization.

Title:  URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE
  URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I am Mr.Sushil B. Shah, the Manager in credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in Africa. I have urgent and very confidential business propos of a transaction. On with my business I want to introduce a transaction that would be very beneficial to both of us. I got your contact from the international directory in my search for a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten million five hundred thousand U.S. dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on the 8th of July 2000 in a plane crash.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.  The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Cantonese must learn to read and write sign language.   We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague.  I will be your foreign partner and you will instruct me on how to apply for the release of the money from the bank on your behalf.  Please, you have been advised to keep business as a secret between both parties.   Yours faithfully,  Mr.Sushil B. Shah                                                                                    SERVO ACCOUNT NUMBER 300,335,547.169                                                                                          ============ Forwarded message ============ From: maryam abacha.

 TREAT VERY URGENT  &amp; RESPOND SOONESTLY… Dear Sir, I am John Abohe, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($18,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $18.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $18.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confid enti; also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.

Please double check that the accounts have been paid in full.  If they have not, we can double check our documentation and double check with the other financial institutions.  Also, if they are authorized to receive, we can provide with a check to send the full amount over to the other party.

Double check that the transaction instructions are followed - for example, do not send the account balance directly to another party, but rather to the ""safe harbor"" account. (The ""SHELTER"" account is for letters 99 and 200, not the ""SHEPARD"" account.)

Next, review the account balance to determine if there are any remaining balances to be paid.  If there are, we are allowed to double check.  If not, we will need the written permission of the department head to continue with the transaction.

If you find any unpaid balances, please contact the seller or the customer service representative immediately.  Withdrawals from the affected accounts will not be honored.

Dear Mr. Karonga,

Cynthia,

My phone number is 713 853 3848.  My  fax number is 713 853 3848.

I believe you and I will be working together.

I have taken the liberty of printing a Certificate of Deposit for our records.  This  will bear his name.  I  will attempt to mail it to him.

We are both extremely excited to have him sign.  We  enjoy working with  individuals that are willing to take a chance on a new opportunity.

We are both eager to expedite his transition to American Express.

Should he decide to renounce his American Express card and obtain a License to Trade, he should be encouraged to do so.  With his new found freedom, he should be encouraged to shop for his own  products in-store and receive his weekly  mail.  Additionally, he should receive a highly professional  recommendation from his  Salesforce.com contact.

Finally, I believe Mr. Karonga should receive an IRS Form 1099 notification that  will enable him to determine the cost of his new  cars and housing.  Based on his  recent living arrangements, it is expected that he will receive valuable  supplemental income for the next  6 months.  In addition, his monthly  transportation expenses will be distributed equally.   If he were to lose his/her/it's value, it will  likely be because his/her/it is being  abused.  Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks in advance,

Angus

Title: urgent response 
 urgent response  &gt;From the Desk of Koutaba The Hon. Principal,EEOC.Liberia. Dear Friend, I am Mr.Koutaba The Hon. Principal,EEOC.Liberia. a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP),Liberia.I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$25,000,000.00(twenty- five million united states dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Ameeraly, died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptian Boeing 747 Airways Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it from the website below.http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly had actively opposed the government of his country, Ivory Coast,and is therefore now at large and unclaimed. We therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly, unlike most unclaimed bodies, has a SIMPLE SETTLEMENT AND ACCOUNTANT FOLLOWING IF HIS FUND IS REMITTED. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 6(six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of Ivory Coast Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Title: ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO.
 ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. Dear Sir, I have a confidential business relationship with Mr.Michael Nelson, a member of the South African Mining Corp. It may interest you to know that I got your contact through my private search agency. These are the facts, as I gather them from his private search agency: 1. Your address 2. Your telephone and fax numbers 3. Your bank name and address 4. Your branch and fax number 5. Your personal fax number and contact information. As the President of the South African Mining Corp, I have the authority of my partners to demand a certain amount of foreign exchange from a particular customer, which was twenty four million, seven hundred and fifty thousand united states dollars.  This amount was intended for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and plantations on behalf of foreign clients. As the senior partner of the mining corporation, I was entitled to a certain amount of foreign exchange quota for the year 2000.  Based on these facts, I decided to seek for a reliable and independent person/company via which this money could be transferred.  The financial company I have chosen for this transaction is very much aware of who we are dealing with and how we got the money in the first place.  Due to my position as the senior partner of the mining corporation, I am in a very sensitive position to not only receive this amount of money, but also be able to transfer it without any hitch.  I am afraid that if I do not remit this amount of money immediately, it will get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is why I have chosen you to be a partner to enable us transfer this money out of South Africa.  I will be with you in-country in no time.  I will be monitoring the whole situation here in South Africa.  You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through my e mail: michael_nelson1@myway.com Thank you as I wait for your urgent response.  Mr.Michael Nelson.

 miss umer Dear friend, I miss umer  your email was very helpful in arranging this transaction.  When I was searching for a reliable and trustworthy person that will assist me in receiving money and valuables  that belong to my late father (or will  if suitable be given to me) that is why I needed your assistance.  I am Miss umer Butler  a female member of the international first world bank (Finance Trust House) in  Geneva,  Switzerland. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out  this transaction that is as  very much for my personal and future welfare.  I am Miss umer Butler  a female member of the finance trust house.  I deposited the sum of US$18Million  (Twenty-eight million two hundred and twenty  thousand US dollar) in a bank branch in the year 2000.  On further investigation, I found out that the bank  forgot to declare the existence of the account to the  bank as we are not allowed by the law of the bank to operate   accounts where the owner is a female and i am a male.    So we will start the  first transfer with US$18Million plus the balance of US$18Million  worth of bank  assets into your account.  Upon receipt of your positive response, we shall send to you   the information needed to start the transfer.  Please send your reply to:   ron_butler@yahoo.com I am aware of the situation in my  country.  I had a female member of the finance trust house who worked with the Geneva  Chamber of Commerce and Tourrism and she trusted me enough to send   a photo of the account to prove that the account is real and that we can have   the money properly. When I got your email address, I contacted you to   help us carry out this deal.   When I got your email address, I exchanged e-mails with you   to enable us proceed.   Miss umer  also recommended  to me  that you should not fail to send me your email   address, so i did not abort the transfer but luckily   i heard from her   that you    are doing fine and i decided to keep this transfer secret for   safety  until i hear from you   again.  I have decided to give you 20% of the total money   after the transfer   after which time the remaining balance will be yours when you   confirm your   delivery to my on (: Miss umer  at  bank) concerned with my   direct   and  confidential     phone and   fax    confidential     confidential     Tel/ FAX:  921 444 444

MUSA GARUBA from Akita Abidjan. I work with the Hellenic  Foreign Trade Department of the gold and diamond corporation. I have urgent and very confidential business  proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the  Greek Petroleum Corporation, Mr. William Smith made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at 50,000, 000,000.00pds (Fifteen Million Pounds and  Eighteen Million Pounds), in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.    After a  month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Greek petroleum corporation  that Mr. William Smith died from an automobile accident. On further  investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. William Smith did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$50, 000, 000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the  pricipal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim  it. According  to the laws of my country at the expiration of  (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Greek Petroleum Corporation if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand as a next of kin to Mr. William Smith  so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government employees. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and for the transfer of the fund into any account  that you will provide. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will be used for the  transfer. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 40/60/20.    Please, I want you to treat this matter as top secret. If you are willing to assist us, do contact us immediately via the above  private e-mail  for more details.   PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET.

I am Mr.Gonzalo Aubiner, Bank of Botswana, House of Bank, South Africa. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6 1999, a gold merchant/contractor with the South African Mining Corporation, Mr. Darby Ogwumukwu, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$15,000,000.00(Fifteen Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South African Mining Corporation that Mr.Darby Ogwumukwu died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999 air crash accident at Benin Republic Airport in Benin,  with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it in your country's airline's website. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin through the South African Government were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Darby Ogwumukwu did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$15,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to Mr. Darby Ogwumukwu, so that the fruit of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. The banking law and order here in my country stipulates that if such sum of US$15,000,000.00 is not declared by the next of kin to Mr.Darby Ogwumukwu, the bank will report the whole transaction as farm fund.  Upon this discovery, I decided to do business with you and get your consent for the transfer of this money to your account.  At first, I will like you to entertain this thought as to why you are willing to assist us in this transaction. I got your contact from our chamber of commerce, I believe it was because of their low profile that we were able to collect this information. I am presently in need of a foreign partner to invest this fund into, but I can offer you 15% of the total amount, 10% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurred during the transfer process and the remaining 70% will be for me as my investment.  If you are interested in this deal, kindly get back to me by sending me your private telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  Please endeavour to keep this transaction confidential, to enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.  Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and regards.

Title: GOOD DAY
 GOOD DAY  Dear Sir,  I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable business proposal,   which I got from your email address   while researching for a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner   who could handle transfer of this magnitude.  I am Mrs Helen Harrison, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am married to Mr. Donald Harrison   who is a miner in gold and diamond ore settlements in the Kruger Gold .   province of South Africa and we are all but lucky to have escaped unscathed during the last   war in my country. I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operations to enable us   receive the sum of US$18,000,000,000.00 (Eighteen million five hundred thousand   United States Dollar) in your account within 14 working days.   I will start by telling you the full story about myself and my family.   Later, you can talk to me face to face to enable us to conclude a very   successful transaction. In fact, I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in this   country as a civil servant(A Banker)), we are not allowed to operate a foreign   account and would eventually raise an eye brow   on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the   reason why it will require a second-fellow or fellow who will forward claims   as the next of kin to the bank so that the proceeds of this account   will be paid to him or her,   This is simple, you will be entitled to 30% of the total amount   when the fund is transferred to your account,   70% when the fund is in the bank account and 5%   for any expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.   Please, you have been advised to keep top secret as I am still in service and intend to retire   from service after we conclude this deal with you. Please, you have been adviced to keep this   deal confidential and as a   professional, you will not admit this to anyone else as   I am still in service and intend to retire from service   assoon as we conclude this deal with you.I will be monitoring the whole   situation here in this bank   until you confirm the money in the account and ask for your support   and cooperation in other business.Ask for your urgent reply Via   this email address helen_harrison@myway.com   Regards,   Mrs Helen Harrison.  ****************************************** SEND YOUR INBOX TO HELENHARNTON@YOUR.COM      HELENHARNTON@YOUR.COM

Title: URGENT BUSINESS/INVESTMENT PROPOSAL
 URGENT BUSINESS/INVESTMENT PROPOSAL Attn: The President/CEO  I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable business proposal, On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (fixed) time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$4,800,000.00(SIX MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, they sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$4,800,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to UNITTED AGE (CN), 40 % of the population is under the age of 21 years and 60 % is female. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and the other officials in my bank now decided to solicit your assistance in the form of a sponsorship of a revocable bank account for us to transfer this money to you and for investment purposes, such as real estate management.   If you would agree to this proposal, I would like you to furnish me immediately with your full names, address, and telephone/fax. I would also like you to provide me with your address if any, and a short description of your company, your position, age, and financial standing.   On your acceptance, I would like you to forward to me the following information:  1. Your personal fax number (+225) 7486908187  2. Your private telephone and fax number  3. Your age and your sex   4. Your occupation and position   5. Your bank name and address   6. Your account number and location where the money will be remitted.   The amount involved is (USD47.5M)   I shall not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is risk free and that you should not entertain any fear as all required information has been relayed to you for an orderly transfer of this money to your account.   TT;ST;TIME:DOM – LE JUETTE MALONNE.

We have located a buyer for the property, and am currently discussing his future plans. ? Should he decide to sell the property, he would still like to negotiate the best price for its eventual use.  If he decides to deposit the cash, then he would like to negotiate the best time to deposit it.   I hope that the seller of the property has done his homework and understands his obligations under the Lease.   I also hope that he has consulted with his finance team to ensure that his account is set up to make this move. ? I know, I know--it can be overwhelming adjusting to all of the new information.  But remember, this is a buyer's market, and you just got  8 weeks to find out. ?

During our annual physical checkups, a gynecological check was also carried out but all tests were well during the time of transfer. On the transfer, the money was approved for onward transfer to any account nominated by the beneficiary and  the funds was paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % was set aside for expenses incured during the transfer process. When i got your contact, i decided to forward your personal information to the bank so that the bank will contact you as the beneficiary, i had an urgent need for a trustworthy foreigner to act as the next of kin to the bank account so that the bank can transfer the funds to you as the beneficiary.   On the receipt of your response, I will forward to you the text of the application which you will send to the bank for an approval and the bank will contact you as the next of kin to the bank account. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 30% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 10% will be for expenses incured during the transfer process and thereafter, you will be given the remainder amount . Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible.  Thank you and God bless you. PLEASE, TREAT URGENTLY. Yours  Mr Michael Nguessane

Dear Mr. Durai Fadaka,

I am contacting you as a way to get a contact name and phone number for MillerCoors, the company that will be dealing with your portfolio.  I am contacting you as I understand from your interview that there is no single contact for all of our companies.  As such, I will need to obtain their permission in order to get a verbal confirm on this deal.

In addition to this, I do not want to be unduly influenced by anyone I consider to be an influence, such as my mentor or my business operations advisor.

In order to accomplish this, I will need to obtain one of the following:

a. A clear description of where your company is located.  This may take a few more days as we have not done any research on this company, but I would like to be able to obtain this information prior to executing this deal.

b. A phone number where I may be happy to be able to be involved.  This may take a few more days as we have not done any research on this company, but I was hoping that you would be able to provide us with this information.

c. A clear reference number where I may be happy to be able to be involved.  This may take a few more days as we have not done any research on this company, but I was hoping that you would be able to provide us with this information.

d. A clear business plan with execution date.  This may take a few more days as we have not done any research on this company, but I was hoping that you would be able to provide us with this information.

e. A copy of our bylaws where we will be executing our agreements.  Should be sent to me at my new e-mail address of milicovik80@hotmail.com

We understand that this may take a few more days to process, but please be patient with us as we go through this.

Once again we ask that you keep this matter in the realm of the utmost importance to us.  If we are to proceed with this transaction, we must ensure that it is done so in strict accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.

We are confident that MillerCoors will be able to execute the agreement, and will in any event be able to prove to the satisfaction of us that it is not in violation of the agreement to pay for the load.  However, if we are to sell the business,

If you could send me the contact info for Benn Steamer (company) I will be glad to give you a call.  I have last night (furthermore yesterday than today) and am about to go to a party.  I would like to talk to him before I go.

I will be in the office all day tomorrow.  If you want to come to the office early you can.  I have a power of attorney for the purpose of notifying him if he should call.  If he calls me back I will return his phone number and let you find out how to get your own.

I'm interested in attending this emergency management dinner.  It looks like we are having some kind of power failure along with the offices.  It will be in our interest to keep this under wraps because I don't want to cause any disruption.

We should be working on getting a confirmation on this dinner.  If we don't confirm it will be a loss.  If we don't lose money it will be a win.   This is kind of our ""do what we can"" mentality.  We can't just send out invites and expect everyone to show up.

Hopefully, everyone made it to their respective buildings.  Have a GREAT week!!

Dear Mr. President,

Just wanted to keep you informed of the progress we are making on our end.  We are now in the process of setting up our mail service to receive our mail on a rolling basis.  Currently, we are using Enron's Priority Mail option to move our mail to the new Service  System (so it is faster and easier).  The new online form will allow us to mail out the letter directly to the customer.  The best part is that it is  totally free (again) -- just enter your information in the online form and click ""Submit."" (Please keep in mind that our online mail  is already processed and will be delivered to the customer)

Once you have submitted your information and confirmed your selection, your account will be created within our system and you will receive a letter with your bank account number as the recipient.

We are working on the next step -- we hope to have this system in place by the end of next week.

Once again, we appreciate your help.

Sincerely,

Boris

 Also, can you send me the account number where you keep all of your spending  - i.e. are you only  allowed $30k in your account ?
 If you continue to have questions, please feel free to contact me at my cell  phone number is 713-853-7658.  Also, you may wish to contact Mr.  Hodge (x36370) at x36370's expense.  His cell  phone number is 713-225-5555. ?

On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$15, 000,000, 000.00(Fifteen Million,five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract     employer, that Mr.David Ameeraly, died in the plane crash of 31 July 2000, on his way to attend a wedding in /at/ Accra, capital city of the   Abidjan Republic. Since we got this information about his death on further investigation, I   decided to take action as his   next of kin to claim his money because I cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or dependent   to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.    On further investigation, i found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was   fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that   Mr.David Ameeraly did not declare any next of kin or dependent in all his official documents,   including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of USD$15, 000, 000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is   being rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of   each year. No one will ever come forward to claim   it.   According to the South Africa Banking and financial law, at the expiration of   (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody   applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that i will like you to stand as the next of kin to

Title: PLEASE, GET BACK TO ME.
 PLEASE, GET BACK TO ME.  Dear friend,  I am Mr.Richard Mabaye. a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural resources.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Martin Jessop made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$25,000,000.00(Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr. Martin Jessop died in the plane crash On October 31, 2000, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:  http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/US/02/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Martin Jessop did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it according to South Africa Banking and financial law, at the expiration of  (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Martin Jessop, so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full and immediate response to this urgent matter.  Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.  Be informed immediately that your bank account has been assigned to you, so that you and your family can enjoy the fruits of this old man's labor without any hitch.                                                                                                               ;

Dear Sir, I am Mr.Alvaro Yusuf, Bank of Africa (B.O.A.C)Ouagadougou Burkina Faso, West Africa. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a gold merchant/contractor with the Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (fixed)deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$30, 000,000.00(Thirty Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Randgold Exploration Company Ltd that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$30, 000, 000.00 and the interest it accrues to the date of deposit is what I now intend to use to fund a company's development in my country.I have since lodged a formal complaint with the high commission in my country about this, but I can assure you that you will not be made to suffer any sort of financial or other harm as a result of my discovery to this development. As a matter of fact, I could have this money sent to any of your reliable and trustworthy foreign bank accounts.What I need from you is to provide immediately your bank account where we can share the money and also to give us a very strong assurance that you will not seat on the money to avoid the share being transfered into your account.If you are willing to do this, kindly forward to me your contact information for easy and safe communication.Please treat this matter with secrecy and utmost urgency. I am ready to give you this undertaking because I want us to be sure that this operation is totally legal and risk free. As soon as I receive your positive response, I will send you the details of the account where the money will be shared.Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thank you. Mr.Alvaro Yusuf.

Before the death of my father on 8th of February, 2002 in a private hospital here in Abidjan he secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has a rock of $7.5million lien with the bank in Republique that he used my name as the only daughter for the next of Kin in depositing of the fund. He also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business associates. That I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice where i will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose such as Real Estate managment. I am just 22years old and a university undergraduate. I am just leaving the university to further my education and to secure a resident permit in another state of my choice. I am honourably seeking your support in the belief that you will not disappoint me when i pray to Allah about your country and country of origin.

Dear WUBOH FADAKA:
  I have just come across your site and am about to click on the ""I'm a Friend"" button.  Since I cannot find anyone I am going to have to ask my fiancee if she will send me the  letter.  She is going to be in Boston this week and will most likely send me the  confirmation by  mail.  Since I don't know if she will also like to send me the  confirmation by  mail, I would like to request that she send me the appropriate  document when she sends me the confirmation.  Any suggestions would be  greatly appreciated.

Title:  PLEASE GET BACK TO ME 
  PLEASE GET BACK TO ME  ATTN. I, on behalf of my other colleagues from the  Federal High Commission for Human and  administrative Rights(F.I.H.CAR) here in Abidjan - Ivory Coast, have decided to seek  and buy house with the sum of, (USD $22.2M) two hundred and  two thousand  million united state Dollars only.  This money came as a result of a contract awarded by my   head office in the past and rightfully so, I had planned for the delivery of these   contracts to the head office of the Federal High Commission for Human and  Administrative Rights, West Africa.  On the delivery of this contract, my head office received a certified   notification from the contracting agency, which we are not allowed to exceed that we   have received from the head office of the Federal High Commission for Human and  Administrative Rights West Africa.  It is because of this that we are now in need of a foreign partner,   who will also stand as the foreign beneficiary to the contract and provide the   bank account where the money will be purchased. We are allowing you all to continue your   services to a top bank account, but we want very much for us to continue   our lives for the benefit of all parties and hope you will honor to provide this   necessary assistance to us.  I have notified you of the remaining steps we are going to take for   our benefit and in order to assure you that our lives are real and we will never let you   forget it. After which we will come over to your country to settle the   sums of dollars and to let you know the actuality of the transaction.  As soon as we receive your reply, we will send to you the text of   the application which you will fill and submit to the bank, which will   then put you in   charge of the entire project.  Best regards,   Mr.Jame Abacha. FHSCRH.

Dear MARIAM ABACHA,

Please send me the name and phone number for your contact and I will work on  a GISB with him or her.

I have recently discovered that I have become a naturalized U.S. citizen, which allows me to become an agent for some of the largest companies in the United States. Among these are, Unilever, Campbell's, Dow, and Philip Morris.  Because I work with a wide range of people, I have begun to discover some  unique  techniques that you may be using to get your business deals done.  For example, you may have found it easier to get in touch with me  because I was previously a part of the internal ENA system and knew the codes to enter the information.  If you need to contact me, please feel free to contact me at my cell  555-7702.

I am also trying to learn how to better utilize my networked skills, such as sending and receiving information from your company.  I will be a better Investor and you will be more likely to get value for your  hard earned cash.

Once again we appreciate the opportunity to serve you  with a superior selection of cigarettes, by far the best in the industry.  BR is the best value priced selection, and we are continually adding to the line-up.  We at Duke however, find ourselves behind on payments time and time again, and the inability to make good on some of our  payments makes us question our ability to continue to serve you.  We have been in this situation before and it is time to get our act together and make some changes.  We need to start making some real estate deals, and if you aren't happy with the results  then it is time to make a change.  We can be patient with these kinds of things as we continue to work on our  taxes and such.  If you are not ready to make a change at this time then you can always email me to let me know and I will give you a call.

COME BACK TO ME!!!!! You are more than welcome to stay!  I can always find a job for you in the future!

Wow, I never imagined that I would wind up here...  but here I am!  And I'm still working!  No job offers yet though I'm sure I'll come up with something soon!

Talk to you soon, Ma!

Sheesh...I feel old coming back from such a successful honeymoon.  I wish I was as beautiful as the photos show me to be.  I wish I was more involved with the group.  I wish I was more social...that way, I wouldn't have to deal with all the ladies.  I wish I was as down to be with you.

But mostly, I wish I was closer to you.

I'd like to spend some time with you...tell me what's new with you...

Title: CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL.
 CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL. FROM: MR. ROBERT WILLIAMS. ADMINISTRATIVE CATEGORY, BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO. Dear Sir,  I am MR. ROBERT WILLIAMS, Bank Of Africa (BOA). I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On July 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the  Petroleum Corporation, Mr.  William Smith made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars )in my branch upon maturity.  Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Petroleum Corporation  that Mr. William Smith died from an automobile accident.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. William Smith  did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of  each year.   My proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. William Smith so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % for Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction  .  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and with my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of our parties as it will allow me to invest more productively and on a more durable basis in your country.  Regards, MR. ROBERT WILLIAMS.  TIME IS OF THE CENTER.

Dear Mr Robert Williams,

My name is Anne Frank.  I am the insurance adjuster for the Depart- ment for the Blind.  In this case, I  think it is in terms of the number of people that we can actually deposit the $.  I can't stress enough how important it is to me that this deal is done correctly.  If we mess this up, or if we discover something I've been doing incorrectly, then I'll  be forced to re-schedule the trip for the next available time, which could be several weeks.  

Thanks for your help, especially since it has been so intractable.

I think that our company would benefit from having a salesperson that is knowledgeable in the  field, as we have lacked that ability up to this point.  We also needed to create a sales force to go along with the  product line that we were shipping.  Having a salesforce is essential so that we can be transparent about our plans, as well as  provide satisfactory customer service.  Having someone in the back room to answer any questions that the customer service representatives have, also helped immensely.

Lastly, I think that our company would benefit from having someone in the back room to answer any  technical issues that might arise.  Having someone in the back room to answer any  questions regarding the product or shipping, also helped immensely.

Lastly, I wanted to commend you on your high level of professionalism.  You were able to take all of the major hits that I  felt I had been taking myself, which is always a good sign.  You were also able to identify potential risks before the crisis struck, which I am sure you will be greatly missed out as a result.

You will be sorely missed out of town, unfortunately.  Not only two weeks will pass without you and I'm sure that things will start to click into place nicely for you.  I really hope that you get this time off to shop around.

 After all, I want to give you allay your thoughts and experience.  appreciation. Please don't take care to do let me know where I have someone show them to him or shear to sell to the bestow. Best regards, Jon  them.

We are bothering for we want to transfer $38 million United States Dollar  (Thirty two million, seven hundred and fifty thousand United States Dollar) to a foreign  account from one of the prime banks here in South Africa. We are willing to pay the balance of $30 million for the safe keeping of the funds in the account until we conclude the transfer. However, we are having a bit of a problem in the bank with some senior staff being murdered in the office and for not telling us the reason why. So, I got your contact through my country section on the internet. We discussed this amount with the bank and the amount transferred was agreed to be for the transfer of a company in your company. I will give you more details on request. However, I will first like you to furnish me with your company name and address so that i can forward the correct amounts to you for the transfer. When you received the above mentioned notification, please kindly send me an email immediately containing the following information: 1. Full Name. 2. Telephone and Fax Number. 3. Occupation. If you are willing to work with us, kindly give me your phone number immediately for more discussion. As soon as I get your positive response, I will also send you more information to enable you proceed with the transfer. Please save me the suspense of this transfer.

Dear Mr.Kofi A.A.,  I have been working with Denise Garvey and Bill Wang on the trading side of the Equitable Life Assurance Company.  They have asked me to contact you to obtain additional information pertaining to the purchase of the property.  This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

1.  How many people bought the property outright?

2.  How many people bought the property in chunks of two or more?

3.  How many people bought the property in small increments of $10,000?

4.  How many people bought the property outright?

5.  How many people bought the property in individual transactions totaling $10,000?

6.  How many people bought the actual house?

7.  How many people still need to be identified?

I am looking for additional information pertaining to this property as part of my normal course of work.  If it is not listed here, please let me know and I will try to find the information.

Well, that is exactly what I am doing right now.  I just got done sending out the email about the multiple-deal transaction.  Then I got an email this morning from Donna that said something about the multiple-party/corporate level of sales.  I take that to mean that this is an isolated incident.

I am contacting everyone involved with the transaction and will be calling you very soon.

I am a trader on the Transwestern (Texas) Corp.  which is the lead equity trading firm in the state of Texas.  We are discussing with them the options available for us to transfer the outstanding equity balances.  As a result of our discussions, we have decided to institute a sales floor on the 5th of every month at the current rate of $150,000.  This is on par with the 1st place financier from our equity conference.

We are also reaching out to our credit department to see if we can get some equity sales underway for the month of May.  It is possible that we will be able to sell some of the non-core assets to cover the debt service payments.

Any information you could supply would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Mike

 from: Omar Goma From: Omar Goma (Jubilee Bank) Old Office Building,Fulton Bank, Johannesburg South Africa. Dear Friend, I wrote to seek your help for a money transfer. I am Mr.Omar Goma, a senior staff in the Bank.I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. On a business transfer of $10m, I deposited the sum of $10m in the bank vault of my branch. I asked my Head Office to instruct the Bank to write to me for the transfer, but they did not. After several months, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from the Head Office that the bank did not write to me either. I later found out that the head office of my branch in my branch did not know the facts either way. I sent a follow up mail and they have not been the same since then. I still can't get the $10m transferred out of the bank. I am requesting your assistance as the person who will act as the new owner of the fund. I am telling you this because I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and ethics here in South Africa does not allow such funds to stay more than 3 years without claim. I don't know this person personally, but I am convinced that you will be able to render this assistance to me as it will be in the interest of both of us. I will give you more details on request. I still need your assurance to enable me make this transfer. Now what I want from you is for you to stand as the new owner of the fund. If you are willing to assist, contact me immediately through my e mail box. Please, call me on my private telephone number: (00226-7885 7598) so that I will give you more details on the details of this business. If you are not willing, then respect the integrity of this transaction and respect the legal rights of both of us equally. At this juncture, it is my duty to introduce myself as I trust that you will honour me by responding as soon as possible. I pray for your understanding. Please call me on my private telephone number 00226 7818 7598 when you receive this letter. Respectfully yours, Mr.Ibrahim Abi

Lastly, could you point me to a person who can  check me into the facilities/equipment that will be used to transport the  products?

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Randgold Exploration Company, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at $4,500,000,000.00(Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)in my branch upon maturity. I notified the bank of the Deposit, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers Randgold Exploration Company Ltd that Mr. Phillip Morris died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with Egyptian  990] with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it from the website below: kafir... http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$4,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it Apparently, as senior government officials who are not from the same country are not allowed to operate bank accounts in my country.My proposal is that I will like

Title: Urgent
 Urgent ATTN: The President/CEO I am Mr. Rao Jahangiri, the Bank Manager in prime bank city  of Johannesburg  South Africa. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$4,500,000.00(Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corporation  that Mr. Richard Moss died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss  did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$4,500,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.                           This sum of US$4,500,000.00 is now the debt owed to the South Africa Mining Corporation by my late employer.                   I have since then made another investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss  did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$4,500,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.                   This is the reason why I am writing you today.

I have since arranged for the money to be recalled to your account from the South Africa Mining Corporation here in Johannesburg  South Africa by one of the local bussiness lobbies. However, I will give you more details of the arrangment when I hear from you. I hope to conclude this business within fourteen (14) working days if you are going to be of assistance.

Dear Mr. Rao Jahangiri,   I shall be very happy to assist you with your project.  I  have just come back from a very successful vacation with my husband.  We traveled to Cancun, Mexico; Phoenix, Arizona; and Costa Rica.  We enjoyed each and every day of it.  We decided to part ways this past August, but were originally going to keep in touch.  I think we will be flying to Houston in a few days time.  I wanted to make sure you were on our good side, and gave you a heads up prior to boarding the 7:00 flight.  If anything should happen, you could always reach me via e-mail or call.  I have traveled quite a bit over the last year, and am used to dealing with a lot of different people.  I also get tired of dealing with the same old shit.  If you are traveling alone, or with kids, I suggest leaving your cell phone at home.  I will be traveling with my 18-month-old daughter, so you and I will be sharing the same cell phone.  I'll be glad when I get back from my honeymoon, and can go over everything.  If you are traveling with me, or one of my other friends, please make sure to tell her the same thing.  If you are not traveling with me, or one of my parents, please make sure to tell me the same thing.  If you are not involved in the least, but want to know anyway, then just let me know.  Thanks.       And finally, if you are still with me, and feel free to call me, I shall it?  be fine.? Good luck. ? Talk to ring in case anything.  depends on what? what level of?

Hi Vince,

Just wanted to make sure you and I are mailing the same day.  I can't find the post office box for ""Sacramento"", but I do have the zip code for ""Wilsonville"" - that is the post office box in Sacremento.  If I exit at 5:30 I will be the one leaving the office at 6:00, so I'd like to make sure I left ""Sacramento"" on my cell phone.  When I do arrive in Wilsonville, I think I will enter the building via the main hallway (does that work for you?  I've had the building wired for some time now, so I'm not sure if I need to enter via the loft or the main building.  My RSVP was terrible, so I guess I'll have to contact you onsite.

Thanks,

Bobby

I feel like giving this email a whirl.  I'm not sure what to expect from you other than the standard ""Hey, how's it going?"" response.  I don't know  what to expect from you other than an ""Amen"" or ""Thanks"" email.  Normally, I'd expect an ""Amen"" or ""Thanks"" email to end  with a ""Pleased to meet you""  statement.  Unfortunately, this isn't the sort of thing that will endear me or your group to the women I work with.  I'd expect a ""Pleased to meet you"" statement to end with  ""I look forward to seeing you at Enron Tower on Thursday morning"" -- not with ""Hey, what's going on in your life?""

So, what's going on in your life?  Call me tonight if you get a chance  and let me know.  Also, send me an email whenever you get a chance  -- I'll be glad to talk to you more  personally.

Once again we thank you for your email, and we look forward to seeing you at Enron Tower on Thursday morning.

Could you send me the name and phone number for your financial institution?  I'm looking for confirmation of  this move.  I'm assuming that you and Mark Watts are at least.  I'm sure that you have documented the move  thoroughly.

Could you either give me the name or phone number for Mark Watts and give me his direct address  to his new company?  I need to find out more about this and mark Watts down as a ""friend"" - i.e., give him a call - but don't take his money.

Mark Watts is moving his corporate office there from Houston to Singapore this week.  He'll be taking a job there full time in January 2002.  I don't know  which office he'll be working from.  He'll probably end up in one of the  Enron buildings across the street from the Transamerica  Building.  If you need any other info, just ask.

I mailed you a receipt for all your hard work - it is important that it is received by someone.  If it is not received by you by the end of next week, then you will be responsible for returning the property to me.  I hope this will be simple....if it is not, then please let me know and I will return the property to you.  I am going to start the process tonight....if you are not ready to return the property by the end of this week, then you will not be able to return to Enron next week.  Any extra costs associated with returning a property to me other than the cost to pick it up from your house will be your responsibility.  If you are ready to return the property by the end of this week, then you will not be able to return to Enron next week.  Any extra costs associated with returning a property to me other than the cost to pick it up from your house to have it inspected by a licensed professional will be your responsibility.

Please forward the resume to Susan M Landwehr at EB1193256.  EB and her office will receive both the oral and proslaureate offers and determine which suite(s) to match them with.  The MOSS Financial District is responsible for coordinating any and all such offers.

Additionally, I would like to share something with you.  As we near the impending decision-making time for our families, I feel it appropriate to share with you what we have been up to this past year.  We have been out to dinner a few times, and some of us have even gone to another restaurant a few times.  We have not been particularly promiscuous, and although I do want to make sure that we have taken care of all our personal lives, I also want to make sure that we have taken care of our personal property in the process.  I think that even though we have been to the movies once or twice this past year, we have not been overly adventurous.  We have taken the appropriate action to notify the law enforcement agencies involved, and we have taken the appropriate actions to keep our personal and professional lives separate.  I want to be very clear about this:  If you have been a party to a dispute between us, or an attempt made to do so, you are hereby INDICTED TO MEDIATE AND RESOLVE THE DISPUTE.  At this point in time, I think that there is not much that we can do other than to try to be helpful and in a timely manner.  If you would like to have your case decided by a neutral third party, you may elect to have it heard by a mediator named at the direction of counsel.  If you would like to have your case heard by a neutral third party, you may elect to have it heard by an arbitrator named at the direction of counsel.

We feel like making a few announcements for the sake of making them, but please do not hesitate to contact us if you have additional questions.

We hope to hear from you soon.

Title: URGENT BUSINESS REQUEST FROM.
 URGENT BUSINESS REQUEST FROM. OFFSHORE ZONE. BORG 1-11 JOHANNESBURG,BURKINA FASO. Dear Friend, I hope to conclude this business transaction that will benefit both of us. I am Mr. pavid omar, the external auditor general in the International Commercial Bank of BURKINA FASO  (C.I.B)  where I am based. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an over 69,000 ton Bombardment aircraft, filled with arms and ammunition, crashed into my bank in the capital city of Burkina faso, causing the death of my clients. Among the dead were the manager of the bank and his entire family, including his wife and only daughter. After the death of my clients, I ordered an inquiry to find out anything about them, and I sent a routine notification to them, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from the bank that my clients and their bank accounts had been seized by the government of Burkina faso  before my clients body was moved. I demanded that the bank release the account to me because it had been seized by the government before. The bank complied to the request and the balance was transferred to my account without  any claim of the funds in the account. Is this not enough for you? I will pay the balance of US$26.5 million (Twenty-six million Five Hundredthousand United State Dollars) to any bank account where my clients  can be proven to have deposited the funds,  according to the law here, as a bonus, to cover any over-invoiced amount that might be incurred by the bank during the course of transaction. So, if you are willing to assist me in this business, kindly contact me through email, as soon as you  have received this letter. Please, treat from me with the utmost attention, trust and confidence, and rest assured that I will be most grateful if you could receive this fund into your account, for which you will also give us a very good rate of return. Please, if you are ready, contact me immediately with these email addresses1@o1.com and 1@o2.com, to enable us discuss the modalities for seeing this transaction through. Regards, Mr pavid omar. -- Original Message -- ""REMITTANCE OF $14.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS  CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE""

Dear pavid omar,

Please contact Jason Reicher at Jason.Reicher@enron.com.    I will fax you Roger's phone number at Enron and give you his home phone number. Roger and I will set up a conference room in our main office and I will bring along Mike Wallis (x-ray technologist) and Stacey Hamilton (assistant to the director of legal) to facilitate the documentation.  In addition to these, I will send you a thank you note and a coordinating Cooper Program Officer to handle any remaining questions.  Finally, I will hand you a brochure which will show our office's address and telephone number.  This is a very positive sign, and it shows that you  are taking this seriously.  We are doing a very good job of filling out the forms and taking the appropriate actions.  Finally, I was given a heads up via email several weeks ago about when we plan to start taking payments.  It is a good sign, and it demonstrates to me that you are taking this  seriously.

Now, onto the deal!  I am calling Drayton Lynd by her real name, and using her maiden name (Sally) for the transaction.  I want to be sure that she understands why she needs to  change her  initials to match those of the other doctors.  She will receive her new  medical license plates today and her physician will issue her with a new set of medallion numbers.  The new medallion numbers will be 1-926-23-8-1, 1-926-23-5-0, 1-926-21-0-0, and 1-926-10-0-0.  The medallion numbers for my car are  1-928-9-0, 1-0663, and 97464.  Please make sure that Sally is aware of these changes in her  driver license or she will need to obtain a new card to continue her employment  here.

Thanks again for your help and I look forward to hearing from you.

I know this email will reach you as a surprise but I am interested  in your business proposition.We want to start a business with you.I got your contact from Yahoo tourist  and this is the reason for this mail. On the date when my father died,  he took us to Bangkok, Thailand and was  poisoned by his own family members.On further investigation, I found out that he  died without having any next of kin and I am afraid. He  planned to cash in this business on the last day of  his life, so I decided to inform you about this  business. Secondly, he left the sum of fifty four million  United State Dollar Billions in a fixed account in one of the prime bank  here in Koh Samui. I plan to capitalize on this money and invest it with my own  hands in a profitable business. However,  I don't know any one here. I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this  money can not be approved to a local person here. I don't  want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The banking law and order here in Koh Samui  is very strict and this request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Koh Samui Citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. In  consideration of this, I will like you to act as next of kin to my late  father. In law, as long as you are a foreigner, you are allowed to open a local bank account  here in Koh Samui without documents. I will gladly give you the letter of  the acceptance to open a bank account and/or to provide address for  the account to be opened. Please, I need your cooperation to complete this  transaction.

More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

VORGAS BENSON , a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (USD28,500, 000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount (US$628.5 million USD) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount.We the officials over-invoiced deliberately.

Title: URGENT BUSINESS ACCOUNT PLEASE.
 URGENT BUSINESS ACCOUNT PLEASE. From:Eric Wong. Union Bank of Hong Kong. 32 Admiralty Crescent, Victoria Island, Hong Kong. Tel:871-44-80-9805 Fax:871-44-80-9808                                                                      CLASSIFIED CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL I am Mr Eric Wong,Union Bank of Hong Kong. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On July 7, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Hong Kong, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Phillip Morris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for the prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. Any bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business . At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 40% of the total amount and 60% for me and my partner.If you are interested, please reply immediately via this email address: erickw111@virgilio.com Regards. Eric Wong.

Dear eric wong,  It is essential that we have the funds in the bank account immediately prior to we initiating any depositary process with SocalEd.  Also, it is essential that we have the funds in the account prior to we initiating any cash depositary or money review process with our bank.  If we are to deposit the funds, we must be aware that we will not be able to do so until we have determined this item. The bank accrual for the period will begin on the date that the accounts are established and ending on the last day of the month. Therefore, it is essential that we have all of the following items before we can deposit the funds:  - The account number:  - The account number is the one representing your ownership interest in the account and is the one we will be attempting to write down on the certificate of deposit. - We will attempt to put the correct value on the stock in the account when writing the accounts statement. - Can you provide us with the name and phone number of this person/company?   Also, it is essential that we have received the funds in a timely manner as we will not be able to enter into any form of written contract with respect to the funds until we have determined this item. This item is also required that we provide for our own office and income tax purposes in the event that we are to be saddled with additional duties.  Please contact me if you would like to discuss this item further.

Dear Mike,

I understand that we may not be able to make a  decision yet.  Perhaps we will have to wait a few weeks?  I also understand that we may not be able to  move the funds yet.  Perhaps we will have to negotiate part of the way  home before we can negotiate the rest?.  I look forward to seeing you on Monday.

Most assuredly,

John:

>>> do you know the guy who will be our draft counselor?

He will be driving us nuts, I promise!

I will give you his name as ""Larry W. Earl"" and  all of his details.

But don't tell him the guy who will be our tax attorney! That is so wrong!

You should tell him the guy who will be your cop, not the one who will be your mediator.

You can also give him Greg White's phone number if you want - that is also fine.

Just tell him who he should talk to and that is going to be that cop.

Thanks

Dear Mrs.Agnes Obudu,

My name is Kevin I am the attorney representing Larry King.  I have been in a bit of a rush this week.  I had originally scheduled a press conference for this morning, but was forced to drop it due to unforeseen circumstances.  I am 99.7% sure that I have communicated with him on this issue already.  I was hoping that we could have this conference last night, but was disappointed to learn that it was not possible.  I will be in the office tomorrow and will make sure to put in a request to have it rescheduled.

I feel like throwing this in place to kind of demonstrate that we are serious about trying to reach a solution.  I don't want to send the wrong message to him if he is going to be under the impression that he will need to contact me.

I will be there with you.  You will bring a pair of black pants and a skirt with no panties and a crop top off.  Your shoes should be about 2 1/2 inches high and wide.  Could you get a good look at your outfit?  Do you have a phone or can you email me with your phone number?

Title: SUMO BENEFICIARY.
 SUMO BENEFICIARY. Dear Sir, My name is Mr CARLOS Juma Masjid, I employed you in my office as a foreign contract   examiner for the oil companies. I was his  accountant and from my office I was able to procure the following information.  1. Total number of crude and    heavy oil barrels   paid for each year.  2. Total number of tankers filled with petroleum products paid for each   year.  3. Total number of money orders, draft bills, electronic money and traveler's cheques.  4. Total number of contracts awarded by my   board of commissioners, which includes the oil company.  5. Total number of foreign visitors to my office during last year.  6. Total number of contracts awarded by my   board of commissioners, which includes the oil company.  7. Total number of foreign prescription drugs imported into my office, which includes   prescription drugs for heart patients.  8. Total number of foreign visitors to my office during last year.  9. Total number of foreign contract workers, which includes foreign and   local contract workers.  10. Total number of foreign customer service officers and their families.  11. Total number of foreign contractors who executed contracts I awarded to   the South African Companies - B.R.A.  12. Total number of foreign customers who paid me for contracts I have to deliver to   them.  13. Total number of foreigners who came to my office for the compensation. The present government of President Jonas Savimbi    has seized all our bank accounts, including my account here in South Africa.   They are not relenting on their effort to make us poor again, so that is why I decided to remove this fund   from my account under my care.  The reason is because I retired from service after a   year of hard labor and I need a fellow to work the pension accounts.  Now my next best hope is that my retirement will secure    for us   a    good   pensioner who will work   for us in his or her spare time while I shall then come over to your country for   sharing of the fund.  I am willing to give   you 20% if you are willing to work with us. I will be your   immediate and    reliable reminder    when this fund is finally   transferred    into your account, which you shall also apply to the pension fund   for   onward transfer of the fund into your   account.   I shall be happy to receive your urgent reply through this   email   Subject: URGENT ASSISTANCE.   Thanks and God bless.   Yours   MR CARLOS

Title: Property Update - From Paul Richard

 Property Update - From Paul Richard 27 QUAY STREET LONDON, ENGLAND. Dear Friend, I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable business proposal. On July 8, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company, Mr. Paul Richard made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at £25,000, 000.00 pence pence (Twenty Five Million Pence) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers in the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company that Mr. Paul Richard died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Paul Richard did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of £25,000, 000.00 pence is still in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the laws of my country at the expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Dutch Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Paul Richard so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for the prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. I will pay into your account immediately you finalise this transaction. If you are willing, please forward to me the following information: 1. Your company name. 2. Your address. 3. Your phone number. 4. Your age. I will let you know the course to follow in order to a sure spot of success. Send me your full name, address, and phone number immediately you receive this email. Thanks for your cooperation. Best Regards, Mr.Paul Richard.

This money was deposited in a Security Company in Israel and we can confirm with certainty that the security company ran out of funds and has been declared bankrupt.

Please kindly note that we have in our custody the corporate transfer paperwork for the transfer.        If you are interested in this transaction, please get back to me immediately.        You should also include your full name and address so that the security company can release the consignments to you.

Lyndon,

Fred will pick your flight and pick up the rest.  He is working with us on the final accounting.

Anyways, good to hear you are getting some exercise.  Go to the gym 3 days a week and get 2 hours of cardio.

You should be getting to the point where you can walk around and see people.  You should be getting to the point where you  can  start to formulate some plans for the future.

I am going to lose interest in this business after this month and probably won't be involved.  I will be turningan interest in real estate  and looking to do some wholesale dealing.  I am looking for opportunities  where I can handle more of a profit share.

 URGENT BUSINESS/VOLUNTEER TRANSFER. From: Mr.Kofi Amode I want to start by introducing myself. I am MR Kofi Amode, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources. First and foremost I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be inform that the South Africa Department of Mining &amp; Natural Resources, Governmental Affairs, and Mining Revenues approved the receipt in my department of your e-mail address as a result of a routine verification. Unfortunately, my chain of command and/or rank in the department does not always view this transaction as something  worthy of confidence. This resulted in me being nominated by the South Africa Mining Corporation (MMC) to work out engineering and contract award contracts with the South Africa Mining Development Corporation. I shall not go into too much detail about this transaction, as it relates to our company's confidential product certification program, as we are still in active investigation and regulatory compliance as the result of a number of kinks in the original award. However, I have secured approval to send you  a cheque for the sum of (USD$9,000,000.00) Nine Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars ($9,700,000.00) from the South Africa Mining Corporation Central Account as a commission. I will be transferring this fund to your account with this bank in South Africa, as the beneficiary of the commission, and for our own personal use as we intend to invest in your country under your guidance. Be inform that the Central Account is a secured account, and will remain so till we agree upon a time after which time it will be opened to remit this money to any other account nominated by the Central Account holder. Be inform that the remittance is subject to these terms and you will be expected to honor all the conditions hereunder for our onward sharing in your country. Note that this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely confidential. On clear evidences that you will  be of the cooperation required to render this claim, note that you  will give us your contact number including your private telephone and fax number for easy and safe communication. Also, remember to treat this transaction with the utmost secrecy and confidentiality. We will appreciate your prompt response as soon as possible. Your's faithfully, MR KOGO AMODE

Title: I NEED YOUR HELP
 I NEED YOUR HELP ATTN. DIRECTOR/CEO. For reasons which will become obvious to you as you read on, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction  that will be of mutual benefit to both of us at the end of the  transaction . During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our deceased customer  who died along with his entire family on the 21ST october, 2000 in a plane crash, leaving no  beneficiary to the account and nobody knows about this account either from the  government or  the previous government. His next of kin was his first  of kin and he was the sole provider of the money for the  entire family and I am the director in charge of accounts. On further  investigation, my officers found out that the dead person was a foreigner and  his only daughter is a Republic of Korea citizen. Considering our  situation from the last time of 70,000 refugees who died  along with their families, I decided to bury them under the cover of night and withdraw  the money from the bank,  before we move on with the business of our lives.  I discovered a deposit of the money in the bank  treasury account as a memorial  of the dead and I have since  taken the decision to move on with my life. In the meantime, I  kept this information secret within myself and  company for now until I decided to make this move  on behalf of my colleagues and myself as we  cannot invest this money in South Korea. The Bank  will be in charge of this fund for us  and we will share the money in the ratio of  60% for the Bank and 40% for the rest of the people  on the staff and I.  Upon the receipt of this mail, I will inform you of  the next step to take and for your support, you should contact me  on my number 00226-7885 75 97 before  you give me your private telephone and fax number.

Can you get a contact name and phone number for me as soon as possible so that I can get a verbal confirm on this for Pete?  Thanks.

See you on the flip side!

Title: FROM: Mr. HOFFMAN M. OBUM.
 FROM: Mr. HOFFMAN M. OBUM. Sir/Madam, Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business relationship with you. Having heard from some trusted persons that you are able to handle outstanding amount of money, I decided to contact you due to my need for assistance and the need to trust you as a person who is capable of handling such amount of money. I am Mr. Hoffman Obum, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant account with a foreign bank in Africa, I contacted the manager of the bank and we worked out the modalities to put you in place as the next of kin. On the routine file of the file, I discovered that there was a settlement of the money in this account and I immediately put a hold on the payment to avoid the account being used to solicit for donations in Kenya and abroad. I and my bank officials now find ourselves in a bind as to how to get out this money without breaching the bank rules against bank foreign account establishment. In the hope of finding some partner who will be capable and fit to act as the next of kin, I changed my plans and decided to write to you for a great business relationship. On this discovery, I decided to solicit for your assistance to execute this transaction with you. On further investigation, I found out that you do not operate a bank account but a private account and I fixed a bank account for the future use of both of us. And you have no knowledge of this transaction. I now seek your consent to present you as the beneficiary of this money, so that we can remit this money to any foreign bank account you will provide, as it will be in your interest to do so as there is no risk involved in this transaction. I have laid all the solemn trust in you before I leave the room. I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business.You are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this business. If you are ready, please get back to me immediately through this email ishon:hoffman_obum@yahoo.com wishing to express your interest. Thank you and God bless. Sincerely, Mr. Hoffman Obum.

Dear Mr. HOFFMAN M. OBUM:

1. The United States dollar is the most liquid currency I know of. Any change in the value of the dollar can easily occur by reading too many different currency exchanges. Also, the correspondent bank accounts of major financial institutions in the United States are written into the books every month. In some instances, the customer will even need to verify this monthly with the bank that the customer communicates with.

2. The bank accounts of my major financial institutions are in the form of quarters, with the exception of the Personal Injury Bank account, which has a cash value of $1500. This is completely normal, given that this is a customer complaint line and not an action or a remedy line.

3. I do not have any indication whatsoever that this account has been used for anything other than payments.

4. There is nothing in the customer agreement or with the bank accounts that would permit me to determine whether or not this account is being used for any other purpose.

5. I do not have any indication whatsoever that this account is being used for any purpose other than paying the bills.

6. I do not have any indication whatsoever that this account is being used for any purpose other than paying the bills.

I hope that what is shown on your report is not what you think it is.

I did not create these accounts, nor did I create the accounts with the intention of using these accounts for anything other than payments.

If you would like to review the accounts, please review the statements provided. If you would like to speak to someone who will do the talking, please contact me at this number.

Dear Mr.Sgtiate,

I am writing to inform you that I have received the list of suggested changes to the Corporate Social Responsibility section of the Firm's By-Laws.  I am attaching the attached memo which lays out the proposed changes.

We have one other consideration which will be considered at the next Annual General Meeting to determine if the issues raised in the Audit Committee's report are covered by the Firm's by-laws.  This is the possibility of having our Sales force manager designate a certain person as his ""craftsman"" and have that person do the actual managing of the craftsman's work.  This person would then likely be in loco parentis with regard to the Firm's accounts and financial statements.  As such, I would like to be able to provide him with a contact person to voice his concerns regarding this area of the Firm's by-laws.  This person would most likely be our Salesforce Manager, as this is the person who would be able to provide him with a unique perspective into the Firm's finances.

I am also attaching my phone number which is 572-387-7195.  This is my location which is closest to the Salesforce Operations Center which is the location where our real-time and inter-line control of the transaction is located.  This person would likely be in the area of direct contact with the Firm, which is located in Enron' S Americas.

These are just some of the numerous things that could be adjusted or changed within the suggested changes.  There is also the consideration of having our Salesforce Manager designate a certain person as his ""craftsman"" and having that person do the actual managing of the craftsman's work.  This person would likely be in the area of direct contact with the Accountant, which is located in France.

These are just a few of the many things that could be done.  I would like to be included in the discussion"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0707.png			Machine

Title: Confidential
 Confidential Attn: The President/Director. I have a very urgent and  confidential business / project suggestion for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Macedonian Petroleum Corporation, late Mr. David Cole made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued GBP12,500, 000.00(Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand)pounds in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Macedonian Petroleum Corporation that Mr. David Cole died from an auto-mobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Cole did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of GBP12,500, 000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to the laws of my country at the expiration of 6 (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Macedonian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you as a partner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Cole so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the lawyer and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Mr Robert Miller Email:robertmiller9@netscape.net Thanks and regards. Mr Robert Miller

There is always next week!  I hope that there is still time for me to go over  my/our policies/familiarize myself with the new  regulations.
As for dinner tonight, I  think that will have to do.  I have been smoking too  much weed the last two nights in a row, and I think I am going to need to take a vacation day or two to  get back in order.

According to the Nigerian law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the  money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to the  deceased for  us to share the money. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full  and immediate response.  SHARE THE FUND 50% TO YOU  15% TO US  10% TO UNITA  5% TO PHONE AND FAX  While the remaining 65% FOR THE PROPOSAL: AND ALSO FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE TRANSFER RATIO EACH  RIDES. I am at your disposition to entertain any  further questions regarding this proposal. Please notify me immediately through my  email box: michael_obi2002@yahoo.co.uk Thanks and regards DR.

Title: URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTEE
 URGENT BUSINESS TRUSTEE ATTN.Sir/Madam. I am a director with the International Commercial Bank, Johannesburg, South Africa. Am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank here in South Africa who died in plane crash along with his entire family on the 1st Oct.2001 in an EgyptAir Boeing 747 Flight 990. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the money in our bank without his permission. But unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin and related person to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don�t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in South Africa is that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. Trusting to hear from you immediately.Your�s faithfully, MR.TAMES JMORRIST

 Your kind attention needed.                                                                                     STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL Dear Sir, with due respect, trust and humility I write this letter to you seeking your help and assistance, hoping that you will treat this proposal with all the seriousness it deserves. I discovered an account opened in this bank in 1987 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some old files in this bank I discovered that an account opened in this bank in 1993 was actually a disguise for an account that belongs to one of my investors who died along with his entire family in a plane crash.                                                          LIMITED TEL:0022878581514 Fax:002287858151517 Alternative:002287858151518 Please, I am interested in selling a contract of mine, which is why i choosed your name and purpose. I am Mr Alhaji Ahmed Abacha from the most oil-rich segment of the Arabian Gulf. It is my wish that i can present you as the next of kin to our late investor so that you can be compensated for your assistance.  The contract was a complete and final, as the prime contractor. I am not making a deal; i am telling you to stand down, as the contractor was a foreigner and my client was a local person here in the country. On the day of the commencement of the contract, the prime contractor left the ministry and travelled to Dubai. On his arrival, he deposited the sum of US$15,000,000.00 US dollars(Fifteen Million Dollars) in a bank here in the country.  On acceptance, the bank gave him a certificate of Deposit and settlement, which he signed and submitted to the government of the arabia.    After this, he deposited the money in another bank here in the country. This money was part of the total sum ordered to be paid to the prime contractor for the contract work done for the past years by the Ministry of Oil.

Title: Re: Re: Your kind attention needed.

John,

To answer your questions 

1. The deal hasn't been confirmed but we are looking into it.

2. The collateral isn't good but we are taking it day by day.

3. It's best to get your office faxed (it may take a while!)

4. Then you can start the process of getting the collateral!

5. Once you have the collateral, you can start the process of getting the building drilled!

6. Once you are happy with the work, send me the completed report and I'll send you the money!

7. Rural Telephone will sign the document before anything else!

8. Have a lovely day!

Love,

Mr. Alhaji Ahmed

I need to get a verbal confirm on this so that we can send it to the right person (if you are still at work today) and there will be time to get it to him tonight. If you find it easier to send it to someone else. (It should be sent to the person who answered the dual question on the company form) 

If this is something you would like to discuss with me, I would like to make sure that there is always a good reason for the misspeaking! <3

Also, I need to make sure that the information is documented for posterity! <3

I didn't send it to the wrong person; it was sent to the wrong person  (in this case, the CCO who would have received the report) !<4

Dear tony,  Please make an appointment for yourself and pass this along to everyone. This  will be the one time you'll  be available (less than  once every 6 months) for a staff briefing.  You'll get an  estimate of the cost and time it will take to get to your  door.  Your office phone number is  listed in the subject line.  This is probably going to be your  only opportunity to speak to someone  about this, so please get to  it early!  Once you make the appointment, please make an attempt to  get a hold of Mark Watts.  He is going to be in a room  with other people.  He'll be able to give you an  estimate of the time it will take to get to  your office.

I have an urgent and  confidential need from you to  assist us  in the transfer of US$ 10.5 Million  (Ten Million five hundredthousand US  dollars) to a foreign account.   On February 14, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with  Shell Petroleum Company, Mr. Lee Raymond made a numbered time  (fixed) deposit for twelve  calendar months, valued at US$35,000,000.00 (Thirty  Million Five Hundred Thousand US  dollars) in my branch upon maturity.       on the    next   business day, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but  got no reply.   After a  year, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the  Shell Oil Company, that Mr. Lee Raymond died from an automobile accident.   On further investigation, i found out that he died without  making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were  fruitless.

Mr.Sella:

You are very welcome to come by the office.  I do not anticipate having to contact you, but if  you are not involved in the current planning phase of the project, you  could conceivably remain anonymous.

I do not anticipate having to contact you, but if you are not involved in the project, you  could conceivably remain anonymous.

I have recently begun studying international financial norms.  It is important to me that the accounts I maintain from  the Middle East are in order.  Many of the items you will supply me with will be legal  for the United States, and I will prepare the necessary documentation to make the  purchases.

I am working on obtaining access to the Saudi Central Bank's Wealth Management system (which is the one we used to establish the  ""Good Housekeeping"" stamp of approval).  This will allow me to create an  El  Paso bond representing the ""guarantee"" of  the savings I make.  Once I am satisfied that the accounts are in order, I will prepare the required documentation to execute the.

Once I have secured the funds, I will mail out the appropriate amount of mail.  I anticipate waiting a considerable amount of time to  receive the goods.

Again, I hope to hear from you shortly.

Title: RE: URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 RE: URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. Dear Sir/Madam, I am Fadaka Randebe,Bank of  Africa, Dakar-Senegal. I have an urgent &amp; confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with  Shell Petroleum Company, Mr. Jim Smith flew to Dakar-Senegal with a business  transaction valued at US$24 million to attend a meeting on contracts awarded by  the Ministry of Mining and Natural Resources.  During the course of carrying out his duties, he was mandated to  collect a certain amount of money per month from the Central Bank of  Dakar-Senegal for the period of time of his employment.  Upon completion of his appointed duties, he was informed that the  Ministry had ordered the bank to stop issuing receipts for the  monthly payment of this amount for two reasons.  Firstly, because the contract was successful and not for some  reason sanctioned by the bank, and secondly because Mr. Jim  died without making a WILL.  Upon the discovery of this fact, the bank issued to him a  notice to provide a DOLLARS  or be done with care.  As it is said,  aloha,  life is  aloha.  As the bank manager in charge of  bank accounts belonging to foreign companies,  I was made aware of this development, when I was under  a staff of protection  I was informed that there is an account  in the bank belonging to a foreigner who died with his  credit balance in the bank as he died intestate.  All documents pertaining to this account have been forwarded to me by the bank  and I have placed this information in my bank account with the  Bank so that  you will be able to retrieve the money owed to you as  you will not know the full story and context of this deal before you  proceed   with   your everyday  life.  Your urgent response is needed.  Reply to me at: randebe@zwallet.com   Trusting to hear from you.   Please, get in touch with this number  (00229 765 78 99)

Title: RE: Credit Contact

Good to hear from you.

I am concerned about this for a number of reasons.

1. It is going to be MUCH more of a challenge to get to San Francisco than it is in London.

2. The interest rate on this deal is astronomical.

3. I am talking to them about relocating this year.

I think it is going to be very difficult.

4. They are going to need permission to move this year's inventory.

5. They are going to need ALL the approvals they can get to move this year's inventory.

6. They are going to need TOKEN approval to move this year's inventory.

I think they are going to need both the approvals to move the investments & the authority to do so.

I think this step will take a great deal of time.

I will try to make this happen asap.

Let me know if you are frustrated.

Thanks,

Randall Coleman

 PLEASE AND REPORT OR NO ONE WILL COME FOR IT ATTN:Sir/Madam,  I am DR. Badr ululi wu, the Auditor General in the Public Accounts Department here in  South Africa.  I have decided to contact you on a business transaction  that  will be beneficial to both of us at the end of the  transaction. During our investigation and Accounting  in this bank, my department came  across a VERY huge sum of money belonging  to one of our deceased customer who died in a plane crash and the account  has been dormant in this bank without any claim of the funds in our bank  before our discovery to this development. The said amount was U.S $30.1M (Thirty million united states  dollars) and we were informed that the account had been dormant  for a very long time without any claim of the funds in our bank  before our discovery to this development.    We are aware that an account is a necessary thing in this business. So we  decided to search  for an investor abroad who will act as the  beneficiary of the fund and also provide the bank  account where the fund will be lodged.    The investor will be paid  the stated sum of $30.1Million upon  successful conclusion of this deal as no other person knows this  account apart from my  department head.    I have agreed to offer you 10% of the   total sum as compensation for your effort/input after the successful  execution of this transaction.   Please, treat with utmost  secrecy and accountability. Send to me  your contact  numbers including your private fax and telephone numbers for easy and safe  communication.    Thanking you as i look forward to  receiving your reply.    Regards,  DR.

Before the death of my father on 8th April 1999 in a private hospital here in Abidjan he secretly called me on his bedside and told me that he has a sum of £15m  left in a fixed deposit in one of the prime bank here in Abidjan, that he used my name as his only daughter for the next of Kin in depositing of the fund. And he also explained to me that it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business associates. That I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choice where i will transfer this money and use it for investment purpose such as Real Estate managment. Sir,  I am honourably seeking your assistance in the following ways: (1) To provide a bank account into which this money would be transferred for investment purpose such as Real Estate managment. (2) To serve as a guardian of this fund since I am only 22 years. (3) To make arrangement for me to come over to your country to further my Education and to secure a residential permit in your country. Moreover, sir, i am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum as compensation for your effort/input after the successful transfer of this fund to a foreign account. Moreover, sir, you can indicate your option towards assisting me as i suspect that this transaction would be concluded within fourteen (14) days you signify interest to assist me. Moreover, you can indicate your option towards coming over to your country to invest, for which I am ready to give you 15% of the total sum for your effort/input after the successful transfer of this fund.

Also, I'd like to exchange last night's currency with him.  It was worth every  minute I took to answer his questions and get the  details.  It will be easier to do this since I  know his phone number -)

Thanks, ArabicWallStreet.com

Hi Ms. Temple, 
Please confirm with your credit department that the account has been set up for your convenience.  This  includes Social Security and the date of birth.  If these are not  included, it is considered a cashless account.  Therefore, it is important to include this information with the invoices.  Your  assistant should be able to provide you with this information.  The account number is  573-6435 or 573-8381 if you are interested in speaking with someone  knowledgeable about this topic.  Your  assistant should also contact Ms. Temple if she is available.
We are updating our payment methods to include a line on the invoices where  we will be able to obtain the items we are selling.  Although this line has not been  drawn, we are making slight adjustments in order to make it  appear that way.  Please review the attached for  any changes that you may require.  Our new address is:

(Do not abuse this opportunity or be discouraged) I am (Saif Ali), the Bank manager at the  Scotia  bank in Johannesburg-South Africa.I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who died along with  his entire family on the 8th of November, 2004 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as  indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the  crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my bank  now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the  next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to  go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law and guideline here in South Africa is that if such money remained  unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this bank is occasioned by  the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Senegalese cannot stand as next to a foreigner. We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner,inrespect  of the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the  business and 60% would be for me and my woman colleague. If you accept this offer, feel free to let me know as soon as you receive this letter. Thanks and regards Mr Saif Ali. Reply back to Hip Hop Home Page

I am Mr White, a Manager in   the financial department of Union Bank Of Nigeria, Lome tetna office.

This amount was accumulated in a Trade   firm in the United Kingdom and we seized it and deposited it in a   bank account belonging to a foreigner here in Nigeria for safe keeping.   The owner of this account is a foreigner and he died without   having any beneficiary to his estate. The request of the owner of this account for a foreign account is occasioned   by the fact that the owner of this account is a foreigner and a mutagouni or no   beneficiary to his estate would be ungrateful and would go against the grain of   the bank. All modalities for the transfer of this money has been worked out .   We have agreed to give you 20% of the total amount for your assistance.   If you agree to my conditions, give me your private number   which I will give to you.   I will also issue you a letter of a authority which will   bind you hand and feet before the money will be remitted in your favour. NOTE:   I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you   agree to receive this money in your account and once you confirm   to continue with me, I will put in writing as below,   1.

Dear Mr White,  I opened up new bank accounts recently & am preparing to deposit some cash.  However, I am not sure how I'll be able to get a good  feel for the customer service I'm getting.

Dear michael isengold,  I did not send the funds to the new account.  I was unsuccessful at getting a contact name and number for the  Administration  (which is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the  bank) and the bank accounts do not have a physical  representation of them. Also, I do not know what type of account I have for legal reasons, but I would  like to ensure that the funds are accounted for.  I also wanted to ensure  that the account was created in good standing with the laws of your jurisdiction, as there have been a few  questions asked of us in the last 24 hours.  Thank you  for your help. We will add your name to the list of approved account owners  on Monday. Sending funds overnight is out of the question as it is possible that the bank could revoke the  account and force the account owner to send the funds in cash, which is not in our best interest.  Also, the account owner could elect to have the funds sent in a lump sum, which is in our  favor as it is in our opinion the best method of dealing with the  issue.  Please take a look at the account to see if your name is on the  approved source list and contact information for all account owners, if you are not already  aware, to learn more about the account.  If you are not already on the account list, click on ""Not yet established"" to learn more about the account.  Now that we have received all the required information, it is important that we provide a  clear description of the account.  Could you do this by email or by phone?  The account should clearly state  what it is for, when the funds are to be sent, and the company by whom the funds are to be sent.  Could you either do this by email  or by phone?  The account should state exactly how the funds are to be handled, and exactly  who will receive the funds.  Did this change recently? If it is, please let me know.  When will these funds be sent? Also, if you need to get in touch with me, or anyone else, by  noon on Monday, January 28th, 2007.    Thanks Mike

Dear Dr Rizie Qunaga, Regarding the phone number of our sales force, we have recently run into scheduling conflicts.  Due to these scheduling issues, we have determined that it is in our best interest to reassess our allocation of the phone numbers in the future.  In addition, in the event that we are unable to locate a particular phone number, please be advised that we will attempt to contact the individual last known to have such a phone number.  In the event that we determine that the individual does not wish to relocate, he/she may contact the General Counsel department at that address.  In this instance, our Sales Force Manager (and, in the event that we are unable to locate him/herself, the Legal Director) will attempt to contact the concerned party.  At this time, it is unclear to us whether the two departments are able to coordinate on a per capita basis.  While we do not have the exact names of individuals to be reassigned as a result of this conflict, it is believed that all parties will be able to agree upon a method of dealing with this matter.  We are also unaware of any plans to assign alternate numbers to this group.  We are working on getting the other contact information for this group (phone number and, possibly, location) so that we may be able to provide the individual with an approximate new number to mail his/her package.    Hopefully, this situation will be resolved soon.  Personally, for the foreseeable future, I anticipate that we will not need to reassign anyone else.  However, we do ask that you will make this clear to all parties, in writing, prior to prevent duplicate entries.  tampering with the intent to avoid the possibility of us assigning an incorrect or overlapping number.  assignment.  as the improper.

If for some reason we are unable to locate him,  I can change his phone number to be Bass.

Title: Mr Bradley James
 Mr Bradley James ATTN: President/CEO. I have a confidential business proposal for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Peter Dekker made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD35,000,000.00(USD35,000,000.00) thousand United States Dollars in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Peter Dekker died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Peter Dekker did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of USD35,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Peter Dekker so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 50:50.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email address immediately. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that the account you will provide will be utilized solely for this transaction. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and regards, Mr Bradley James  e-mail address: david_bush64@yahoo.ca

Hi Mr Allen,
 Good morning.  You and I have been working through the details of your package.  I thought I would sort through the rest.  I was hoping you could give me a call  to get a better idea of the layout.  I'm sure you will be glad to hear from me.  Hope you have a safe trip.
 
 The next time you are in Houston, please make a note of the following:
 a.  Any changes you would like to be made to the Arrival  Confidentiality  Agreement?
 b.  Any phone numbers that will be necessary to reach me?
 c.  Any documents that will be helpful in establishing our lines of communication?
 Please contact me with your changes.  I will be glad to adjust my address and make sure my phone number is up to date.
 On a different note, I wanted to share with you a little something.  I have taken the necessary  actions to ensure that no one is making any attempt to illegally import goods into the United States.  There are several instances where this would be possible  (eg. I could be wrong, but I'm not sure where this would come from).  I am working with the Enforcement  Department to try to make sure we get this resolved quickly.  If you notice anything  wrong, please let me know.  I'd be happy to correct me, or point out an example.

I am making this transfer project to buy arms and ammunition from South Africa. The informed consent of my colleagues requires us to pick a region outside our own country to receive this sum of US$138.500($160,000,000.00) for our own use but we could not welcome this sum inside our country because this money is in US Dollars and the former owner of this account Mr. John Dando is an expatriate South African and he has absolute Presidential immunity.                              He is leaving the country.                                     He is the real owner of this account.

I will give you the details of this business when I hear from you.     I will like you to send me the sum of US$138.500($160,000,000.00) when the money gets into your account.

If we do not agree to this transfer, I will call you in the and inform you that your account has been transferred to my confidential bank account.

I think we should expect the unexpected on these kinds of deals.  We did not send the check to the post office.  We received the check on Friday.  It is possible that the SEC ruled in our favor.  We will have to check with the bank to see if they will benefit from the new policy.  We will provide additional documentation as needed.  If you are not involved in the equities industry, but would like to give us a call, please contact Paul J Leanza at (713) 853-5635.

Sent Tuesday evening while I was at work, I received the parcel containing the check.  I immediately opened it up to ensure that it was received.  Upon closer inspection, I could clearly see that it was.  Upon closer inspection, I could also clearly see that it had been.  Very nice of you to do this.

Also, I felt very fortunate to receive such a thoughtful note from you.  You were able to show them the value added by using my name as the source.  I was able to prove to them that my work product was of high quality and consistent with your expectations.  I wanted to give you an indication of the level of work that you expect of your staff.

I hope that you will consider using my services with confidence.  I have demonstrated over the past 12 months of high level professional service to you and have found that I am able to deliver.  I was looking forward to using your services with a project that I am very happy with.

Many thanks in advance,

Sam

I don't know if you know this, but I made a mistake.  I sent you the resume with all the  information, but it didn't have the ""undercover cop""  info.  At the top of the form, it should read like this:
  ""I am an Undercover Cop/Enron Agent and need the names and affiliations of five people  who work for Enron in the United States or other jurisdictions.  Please see if you can find these  people."" 

I didn't send you the resume, and when I mentioned to my friend Jane that I might be able to, she immediately replied with the names of two other people, so that you could go to  find out if they are also working for Enron.

 FROM: Mohammed Otman  BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER, BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)PORTOU-LUMPUR BURKINA FASO. Dear Friend, I have a proposal for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the BoA, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000,000.00(twenty-five million Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the BoA that Mr. David Ameeraly, died in the plane crash of 31 October 2000, an Embraer Boeing 767, which was enroute to Los Angeles, CA from Dubai, United Arab Emirates,indefinitely.  On further investigation,i found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank's bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it and according to the Burkinabe law, at the expiration of  (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Burkinabe Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that i will like you to stand as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 50:50.Please, upon the receipt of this mail message, send to me the following  to enable me start the processing the fund transfer to your account: 1)Your Full Name- 2)Your House Address- 3)Your Phone Number and Fax Number For more clarification and details,please get in touch with me immediately through my above private email: suzhen_o@yahoo.com Regards, Mohammed Otman.

Dear Mr.Omar Mirza:  I had a dinner with your friend Jay-Bryan for dinner last night.  I know all the major places and things I could have, but I was afraid that if I left I might miss some important decisions that I should be taking.  I also wanted to give Jay-Bryan an opportunity to show him the house he is moving into (his current one, unfortunately).  I want to give Jay-Bryan a call if you are available.  If not, I will send him a check and expect him to make the transfer.  I think this move will be good for Jay-Bryan. I am moving into his new place in Jamaica in the next couple of days, so I will give him a call if I can. He is living in that neighborhood behind Haverty's in SoHo. I am staying in that neighborhood and doing what I can to make that happen. I can be reached at 415-243-4731 if you are looking for something.  I am starting to feel like an American...just move in  there and have fun! -Missy

 urgent response ATTN: President/Director. I am President Fazle Hamza, the son of late Dr.Kofi Amadou Hamza, also known as Namou Mbolhi. We are farmers and industrialists based in the Rand Province, in West Africa. I have lost confidence with any member of my family member who is not of the same colour with my father. He was poisoned to death by his own family members on the day of harvest time in 1997. Shortly before his death, he told me that he deposited the sum of US 8.2 million (Eight million, two hundred and twenty two thousand U.S. dollars) in one of the private  bank vaults in Africa. I have been farming and  manufacturing in the same locality for the past 13 years and I have the documents to prove that the money was  produced in the  country. The bank account where the money is now  being held by the Rand Central Bank. I am contacting you to   arrange for the transfer of this money to your account, I have decided to give you 20% of the total  transfer sum, while the balance will be mine and my family's share after the transfer. I will be monitoring the whole situation here in the  Central Bank until you confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country  for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated  and further investments, either in your country or any country you might   recommend. All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I suggest to give me your fax number immediately upon your reply. As soon as I hear from you, I will let you know the next step to take. I expect your urgent reply. PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET. Best regards, Fazle Hamza.

On June 6, 1999, a Gold  Consultant/Contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, Dr. Mohamed Abacha, made a numbered time  (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$25,000,000.00(twenty five  million United States Dollars) in my branch upon maturity.  On  maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but  got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, Nigeria Chambers of Mining &amp; Natural Resources that when he  died in (Exeter) on the 6th of December 1999, he  left a will, which  is what I  made up as an explanation for why we  did not  disclose the will to the other  branches of his  family . Immediately we  sent a notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.    After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  contract  employers, Nigeria Chambers of Mining &amp; Natural Resources that  Dr. Mohamed Abacha, who died on 1st of January 2000,  left  no WILL and all attempt to trace his next of kin were  fruitless.

On June 6, 2000, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Ameeraly made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at  twenty four million three hundred thousand United States Dollars.   in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation  that Mr. David Ameeraly died in the Plane/Stratfor crash of 31 January 2000.    On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly had / died without a next of kin. This sum of $32.500,000.00 is still floating in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of  each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of  (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the fund.   Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an individual to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. David Ameeraly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account inany part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in shares that are to be paid in two parts (30%) for us to share in the ratio of 40% for me and 60% for you.   As soon as the money gets into your account, you will be given a guide  that will help you   invest it wisely. Expecting your urgent reply.   Best regards,   Mr. David Mccarthy.

Title: IMMEDIATELY CALL ME
 IMMEDIATELY CALL ME ATTN:Sir/Madam  I am Mr. Patrick Chima, Bank Manager  of International Commercial Bank,  Lagos-Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business  proposition for you.On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with  oil ministry  company in Cameroon, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time  (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$15,000, 000,000.00 (Fifteen Million,  Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but  got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract  employers, the oil and minerals ministry that Mr. Barry  died in an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without  making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were  fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.  Barry did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents,  including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$15,000, 000, 000.00 and the interest  is being rolled  over with the  principal sum at the end of  each year.No one will ever come forward to claim  the  fund and according to the  Nigerian Law, at the expiration of  (Six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the  Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the  fund. My proposal is that I will like you as a  foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly  so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your  full name and address so that the attorney will  prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in  place as the next of  kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain  the necessary documents and letter of probate / administration in your favor  for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will  provide will  then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio  of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10 % will be set aside for  expenses incured during the business.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this  transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the  successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this  email address immediately. Upon your response, I shall provide you  with more details and relevant documents that will help you  understand the transaction. Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy  communication.  Respectfully yours,  Mr. Patrick Chima.

If they will be voting in the by-election, then they should probably bring along some ID.  For the general election, I think they should bring along a passport.

Anyway, I'm very sorry to be losing time, but I think we will all be better off voting for Williams.

Title: Request for assistance from you,  Belgium.
 Request for assistance from you,  Belgium. Dear Sir, I got your email address  while searching  for another who will be capable and willing to assist me in this  business. We will start by going over the details. I am the Managing Director of  accounts management section in the cash haven municipality here in  the Netherlands.I am writing following the impressive  information about your company from foreign financial services  firms that I have received about your company's business practices.In fact, I can name  more foreign financial services firms abroad that I have contacted and  I will rely on them to fasten this transaction. I have a very urgent and  confidential  need for your company's bank account number, to enable  the transfer of the fund to any foreign account you will nominate. The amount involved is 15,000,000.00  (Fifteen Million US Dollars) only. I am contacting you because of  the need to transfer this fund to your account for my personal investment. I  have decided to part company with you because, in my department, we discovered an abandoned sum  of $ 15,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million US Dollar) in an account  belonging to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family  in a plane crash on the 1st Oct. 2002 in (Egyptair.com - www.egyptair.com)  plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his  next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it  unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or next of destination  to the deceased as indicated in our un-disclosed contract documents with  our bank.          However, all his supposed next of kin in the banking services  department  died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the  claim.      This sum of US$ 15.5M is still sitting in our bank  and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end  of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.   This means that the money will be for us  as  the fund owner after the death of the  owner.                This is the actual situation that we are in now and we  hope that  you will come to us for help in the  transfer of this  money to any account you will nominate. We have agreed to give you 20% of the  total sum for your assistance and 5% for the expenses  incurred in the course of the  transfer  and the remaining 75% for the fund  management.                               Please  send your reply through my email address  as you received it from the dead  customer service representative.    Have a nice day as we wait for your urgent  response  Yours faithfully,    Emilio J.

Title: Re: Re: Request for assistance from you,  Belgium.

Hello,  I am sending you a revised copy of the CV I sent to Jacqueline Cowie.  The  amended CV states that I am a consultant and work for a trading  company called Innotek (formerly known as First Analysis  Concepts).  I am not an employee of Innotek, I have never filed  a tax return with them, and my work  location is very difficult to work from.  Therefore, I am trying to be as accurate as possible with my  information.  Unfortunately, the cost of sending the amended  copy of the CV to me was prohibitive.  Also, because the number that you sent to Cowie is  so high, it is difficult to  justify sending a lower number.  Finally, because you sent me a video diary  of your trip to Houston, I will try to make it   useful.  It is important to emphasize that I did not ask for any   special treatment during my stay  in Houston.  I simply wanted to be assured that everything was accounted for  when you returned.  You will of course receive a confirmation email with your  new  phone number and all other necessary information. ? I hope that I had been sufficiently  helpful during your stay  in Houston.  You certainly have been  very pleasant with me. ? I have enjoyed talking to you  over the past several weeks.  I think that you have a  great deal of insight into your own  perspective on things.  I hope that you have made a decision that is fair  and reduces your overall exposure to  uncertainty.  I know, for one, I have! ? If I had my druthers, I would move  immediately from my present position to  re-initiate my own business in this area.  I would greatly appreciate the  consideration.  I think that your advice will be  very helpful in this regard.  I would also like to take care of as  soon as possible since I think that this area of our  agreement will make a difference.  I would ask  that you please make this adjustment immediately.  I have been doing my best,  but I think that you may have found the time to  think about it.  I have been trying to explain to you  the benefits of insuring the financial welfare of all our  party members.  To accomplish this, we currently have a segregated  account with First Analysis Concepts.  The account has been  set up for trading purposes only."

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $18.5M (Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars)m, in an account that bordered on the excess of $12.5million. We have since traced the entire money to a private bank in Africa, where the owner was a foreigner and the account was established.  This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for our farms and we were therefore forced to import most of the chemicals for our farms from abroad.  Currently, we are exporting some of the seed- sows to feed the local people because the local people are very poor.  The present government of Robert (SLA) le Sime, are not interested in our interests

 From: AMENDA ABACHA Good Day,                                                This message to you, must have gone over your head as it is very confidential and top secret. I am AMENDA ABACHA, the personal confidant to the late president of Nigeria, who died on 8th July 1998. I got your contact through my UNEEDO E-CTATP and E-mail.

Dear AMENDA ABACHA:

Thank you for your email. It is the first time we have dealt with your arrival on a flight.  Our procedure was to process you the night before you boarded the flight.  However, we now understand that we could have sent you on a later flight.  Therefore, we will expedite the process of flying you to Doha.  The delay in getting you to Nigeria is not in our interest.  Your trip would have been much more comfortable had we done this.

We actually sent you a personal message prior to your trip to Doha to let you know that we were planning to send you to Doha, and we were going to pay for your stay with AA.  We feel we have done this in the past, and we are not going to do it again.

Please make contact with me to let me know your situation, and we can work out a plan of how to proceed with you.

Sincerely,

Amanciello, Chris

I am currently involved in negotiating with another party who are interested in purchasing some of the plant material.  The price to which you would like to negotiate would be in the range of $2500-3000.  Could you please provide us with this information?

Title: RE: REGARD FIND TRUSTEE
 RE: REGARD FIND TRUSTEE ATTN: Sir Please, I wish to solicit your confidence in this transaction. My name is Mr. Randall Chan, a native of Hong Kong, but reside in mainland China. I am an Executive Accountant with the People's Bank of China, 1-Fangshan Road, Central City. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.On July 8, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the People's Bank of China, Mr. Ben Johnson made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14,500,000.00 (Four Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the People's Bank of China that Mr. Ben Johnson died in the plane crash On October 31, 2000, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) Flight 990, (an Airbus 330) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:  http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Ben Johnson did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$14,500,000.00 is still sitting in my bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Laws of Hong Kong, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Ben Johnson so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you the contact of our bank Attorney for the prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. It is at this stage that you will be given 25% of the total amount, 70% would be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might incure during the process of this transaction and 5% will be set aside for charity both in Africa and in your country as well. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. Yours truly, Mr. Randall Chan

Dear admin,  I received the report and it contains all the information.  However, there is one thing I would like to change.  From what I gather, you are budgeting a maximum of $3,950.00 a month for next month.  That is on top of the $3500.00 that I have already included in the initial spending.  If I may ask, was there any way that we could increase that to $4000.00 a month.  After all, the closer we get to starting to receiving the funds, the sooner we can begin to process the payments.  I think it is safe to say that we will start to execute the plan to move our cash into our bank accounts.  Once we receive the funds, we will start to execute the move.  Once executed, our cash will deposit with Northern Trust & Doorstep, and once that is processed we will deposit with First Analysis Corp.  My phone number is 713-646-7932.  I believe that we will have a meeting to discuss this plan at some point in the future.  I will be in our office the office until then out in the office.

Title: Re: Re: REPORT OF TRANSFER OF SALARY

Reagan,  I received the report and it contains all the information.  However, there is one thing I would like to change.  From what I gather, you are budgeting a maximum of $3,950.00 a month for next month.  That is on top of the $3500.00 that I have already included in the initial spending.  If I may ask, was there any way that we could increase that to $4000.00 a month.  Afterall, the closer we get to starting to receiving the funds, the sooner we can begin to process the payments.  I think it is safe to say that we will start to execute the plan to move our cash into our bank accounts.  Once we receive the funds, we will start to execute the move.  Once executed, our cash will deposit with Northern Trust & Doorstep, and once that is processed we will deposit with First Analysis Corp.  My phone number is 713-646-7932.  I believe that we will have a meeting to discuss this plan at some point in the future.  I will be in our office the office until then out in the office. So I think it seems to me that we are already on the same page.  doing the same page.  However, I do not sure. Does this address any other accounting would be necessary.  to indicate where our actual expenses are you to indicate where our actual expenses incurred.  - as opposed to implied if you were assumed.  that we are  expenses to reflect our actual.  the actual.

 urgent reply. Dear Friend, I am Ndebe kabore, the Director incharge of Auditing and Accounting  departments in one of the prime banks here in  Johannesburg, South Africa.I am writing  this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out  this business opportunity in my department. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa Mining Corp, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time  (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,000,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars)in  our branch upon maturity.  On  maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply,  so we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Africa Mining Corp  that he died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with EgyptAir Flight 990] with other passengers on board.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without ever making a WILL and  all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$10,000,000.00and the interest is being rolled over with the  principal sum at the end of each year.  This is what I did not know at the time, and still  do not know.  I have since  discovered that no other person knows about this deposit, and my  position as the Head of bank guarantees the success of this  scheme.  I can only hope that this  scheme will succeed without any infraction from your side.  Please, if you are willing  to assist, contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number for more details.   Best regard Ndebe Kabore

Please contact PLS about the best time for us to send out the form W-9 for the taxman.  For your information, we will send you a suspension letter via regular mail.  If you are not ready to sign-off on the suspension, then you will need to either give us your name or a valid email address and we will send you a form to send us the suspension back to us via regular mail.

Once you receive the suspension letter, you will need to contact your friend or another PLS member and let them know to which department they should send the letter to.  Typically, this will be the department where the suspect is employed, but your friend can be your contact at home or work.

This process should be completed by your friend or another PLS member by now.

Dear Friend and Fellow Convenor:

Steven M. Harris, a trader in the Insurance Department of Enron North America, would like to schedule a phone conversation with you both regarding
 the merits of the PLS Program (http://psc.pge.com) and the merits of using the PLS Program.  He is able to make this request because his
 Insurance Department contact, Ms. Charlemagne, passed away last week.  She is now inimical, as she was so important to Enron.  She would have approved of any of our
 financial counsellors using the PLS Program.

Ms. Charlemagne received her B.A. in international relations from the University of California, Los Angeles, and her
 T.D. from Emory University.

She was a member of the American Institute of Thai, and from time to time has acted as a
 dues-paying member.  She was the Chair of the Asian Pacific Economics and Finance Subcommittees
 of the NAS, and of the NERC Energy Finance and Markets Subcommittees. 

She was also a past-president of the Asian Pacific Foundation, a
 non-profit organization that works to enhance the public sphere through research and education.

Ms. Charlemagne is buried in Taiwan, and will be in the
 Philippines on Thursday, March 15 for one week.

Ms. Sakamoto is currently in Canada, and will be in Toronto
 on Friday, March 16 for two weeks.

Title: FROMER MUGHE
 FROMER MUGHE FROMER MUGHE DR. ERIC WONG MANAGER AUDIT &amp; ACCOUNTING SECTION BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO. Dear Friend, I am Mr. Eric Wong the manager in account accounting section in bank of africa (BOA). I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an America Oil consultant/contractor with Petroleum Corporation, Mr.  Ahmed Yousef Mustafa made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$10,000,000.00(Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, oil contractor that Mr. Ahmed Yousef Mustafa died in the plane crash On October 31,1997, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below: &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempt to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had actively opposed the government of president Mohamed Obeidi and was consequently driven from office. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mustafa had deliberately kept the $10,000,000.00 in cash in a security company here in Burkina faso. This amount $10,000,000.00 is still in the security company and it is safe in my company. My share of the $10,000,000.00 was US$1million.00, 10% of the US$10,000,000.00;5% profit. The security company will pay us 25% of the net amount US$10,000,000.00. I accept your right to privacy and confidentiality, and request that you please treat this matter as top secret. Please get back to me as soon as possible. Note that this transaction is 100% safe, on  smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total amount. Attention Please, I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation based on the understanding that no man is an island and no transaction is impossible with this information and the assurance that you will be very much obliged to respond as soon as possible due to the secrecy attached to this transaction. I have considered the financial transaction and the amount involved is in the range of $10million US$10million.00. Please if you are capable, contact me immediately. Best regards Eric Wong

Title: MY INTRODUCTION
 MY INTRODUCTION Dear Sir, My name is Mr.John Moyo, a member of Independent Committee of Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the duty of compiling and maintaining accurate list of all foreign bank accounts belonging to non-Swiss indigenes throughout the world. ICEP makes all necessary arrangements to ensure that all claims for the fund were made, but due to the non-Swiss Identity. Consequently, all bank accounts belonging to non-Swiss indigenes are being monitored and all remittances are being under way for the payout to any foreign bank account that can be convincingly guaranteed as being owned by a non-Swiss indigen. Due to our position as civil servants, we cannot stand to claim this money ourselves and so the Central Bank of Switzerland (CBC) has been authorized to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account for this transaction within a reasonable time. At this stage, all we want is for the note to be paid to any foreign bank account that can be convincingly guaranteed as being owned by a non-Swiss indigen; however, due to the sensitive nature of our jobs, we are not going to give you 100% security as all arrangements have been made for the transfer. On successful remittance of this fund into your account, you will be compensated with 20% of the total sum not being paid into your account due to our sensitive position here in Switzerland. Though, your account has been setup for a transfer of this nature, please be assured that all modalities for fund transfer have been worked out and all modalities will be finalised upon your acceptance to move forward. We are however ready to entertain any questions from you for a thorough discussion. Please write via the above email, solely for your view. Note that the transfer will only take us about 14 working days to finish the transfer; you should email us at: icepe2003_200701@yahoo.co.uk thanks for your anticipated co-operation. Thanks for your kind response. Sincerely, Mr. John Moyo

Title: RE: PROPOSAL
 RE: PROPOSAL ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO. I am (Michael wu      ) the above stated reason why i decided to contact you on this transaction/ business of a confidential nature. I got your contact through our chamber of commerce here in South Africa for our mutual benefit. During our tour business-center in the center of the continent, i stopped in front of my bank and presented my business proposal to them, then i asked them to please honor me as their next of kin because we have discontinued all transactions with any body besides my family and I because my father   died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. After i submitted my business proposal to them, i proceeded to deposit the sum of US$16.5 million  ($16.5 million) in their branch. This sum of US$16.5 million was money i keep in a box in my bank in my home city Johannesburg. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machineries and chemicals for the farms,but instead, it was used for the fabrication of fake will, and eventually for the money i keep in my home. I have since then i have secretly discussed this amount with a trusted banker friend who advised me to secure a foreign bank account, as it may be of use to me in the future. I am at this moment looking for a foreigner who will act as the next of kin to my late father, so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. I have been advised to forward your contact to the banker so that we can proceed forwarding all the required documents to the bank. I have decided to do this only because I want this money to be send to any foreigner, and my banker friends are using every trick in the book to protect us from seeing this money's, but we will not give up hope either, as all the legal documents that will back you up as the next of kin to my father will be secured and you will send me the documents over the bank's secure e-mail, which I will copy and paste into any suitable e-mail you will send over my banker's secure e-mail which I will forward to the bank's management. Please refer to the pictures in the message as it will explain how this money will be remitted. I will be waiting for your reply. Please, during this time you will also inform me of your personal fax number and phone number for easy communication. Yours truly, Michael wu Please Reply Back

 URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE. ATTN.ENGr.I am Engr.Kofi Zuma, the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting  department of the  Bank of Africa (B.O.A)Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa.  With due respect, trust and humility,I have decided to contact you on a    business transaction  that  will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our  investigation and auditing in this Bank, my department came  across a very huge sum of money belonging to an   deceased person who died with his entire family on a plane crash on   October 31, 2001, a Boeing 767 Flight 790 which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in   existence since October 31st, 2001.  From the records of the bank he was able to trace his supposed next of kin    from the records of his bank in Nigeria to my bank, but on   closer examination it was discovered that he died without giving any   heir and all attempts to trace his next of kin was   fruitless.   The discovery  of this   anomaly and the reason why we are contacting you now is because    from the records of this deceased person's bank in Nigeria,   there is a claim  against his account but the account has remained dormant    without any claim of the fund in our bank. The account has been dormant    without any claim of the fund in our bank ever since   the death of this   deceased person.                           The bank   is now expecting a  tranfer of this fund to a foreign bank account but the account has   been dormant for   years. The amount involved is 23M,seven hundred and fifty thousand   (USD)Seven hundred   dollars. We are ready to settle the fund in any bank account in your country but the accounts of   ordinary people are not safe, and especially   account of  such high  security are not safe. The account has been dormant for   years and no body will ever come forward to claim   this fund. The account has been dormant for   years. The account has been dormant for   years.

 URGENT BUSINESS OFFER ATTN: President/CEO  I am Mr.Arthur Tamimi, the Bank Manager in Provence, in Western Sahara, North Africa. I got your contact from our chamber of commerce here in Western Sahara because we are poor and isolated.  I am writing this proposal to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my department. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the government of North Sudan, Mr. Charles Ballassi made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$28,500,000.00(Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars )in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the North-South oil pipeline company that Mr. Charles Ballassi died from an automobile crash.  On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Charles Ballassi did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$28,500,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  My proposal is that I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favour for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you account. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 35% for you and 5 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business.  There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.  If you are immediatelyvia this e-mail address immediately.  Please allow me to assure you that my bank does not affect your prestige if you are not ready to assist me.  Please, I suggest you reply me immediately via this e-mail address .  Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.  Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.    Yours Faithfully,    Mr. Arthur Tamimi.   END OF PROJECT

Dear Mr Arthur Tamimi,
Thank you for your email.
Vince Kaminski and Stacey Home Products wanted to sell U.S. Pipelines.  We wanted to sell to:
(1)  BRWA/EES (Which is a diversified energy company that trades in both Energy and Finance products; (2)  NWE (Now Energy One)  (3)  Total, as a group.
We did not know which of the mentioned companies would be suitable; however, we did want to deal with the possibility that one of them might be a Buyer Protection Program sponsor.
We also wanted to deal with the possibility that there might be restrictions on our ability to deal with certain companies.
Please find attached the Legg Mason & Stonehouse whitepaper.  This is a representative sample.
I am aware that these kinds of things take time to sort out; however, I thought we would have our say about it sooner rather than later.
I wanted to deal with the following matters 
(1) Identify potential Buyer Protection Program memberships and explain to them the nature of the program;
(2)  Describe in detail the programs you have participated in;
(3)  Establish a mutually convenient time for all to visit our site and have a tour of the place.
Many thanks in advance for your assistance.
Mike

John,

Could you send mine and Stacey Home Products names and phone numbers for Chris and Steve to go to the bank account where they receive their quarterly tax deduction?

I have always felt that they should be paid directly on the books they created; however, it is difficult to make good use of every dollar that they earn.

Please find attached the following documents.

Please advise if you need anything else.

We, at Hotmail, are aware of the potential for a lawsuit between Enron and its primary dealer, which could result in discipline for both parties.  We are investigating this possibility, and will provide any information that helps us to find out more.  As mentioned, we are not able to predict what type of action or settlement may be reached, but we believe the potential loss for both parties is substantial.  We will be able to recover some of the potential lost money by charging the other party directly, or by recovering the difference from the charge.  We believe this will be a very small amount of money, but could have a major impact on our bottom line if true.  If this investigation leads to any conclusion, we will provide the following information to our Owners:

What is your company's mailing address?

What is the phone number of your main office located?

What is the closest business to your main office? (Please make S-Mart the closest business by a reasonable amount of time.)

What is the general policy of your company regarding credit card debt? (Do you check your debt at the end of the month when it is due or is it mailed directly to the wrong address? )

) Any additional information that you are able to provide, including account, Social Security or card numbers that will be helpful to us in processing our payments.

Our hope is that by providing this information, you will be able to shed some light on this matter and allow us to determine whether we should proceed with this arrangement.  If you need to contact us, you can do so at 713 853-4804.

Our office is 713 853-4743.

Hello Ed,

Could you change the word productivity to investment banking instead of  analyst/trader/contract manager.  That is the name of the product they are selling.  This is the second  sale we have had in a month.  We have had no issues with any of our previous two  sales.

If you can change the word investment banking to analyst/trader/contract manager,  that would be great.  That is the name of the product they are selling.

After going through some old files in the records I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Henry Mowle, a foreigner, who died in Malaysia Airlines Boeing 747 plane crash in the year 2000. He left the following beneficiaries and the balance of $21.2M is being  stored by this Bank as unclaimed Bank Expense.  The above and  other top secret files of this bank are kept in my Construction Dept. These files include but are not limited to, application for foreign account where this money can be be transferred without the knowledge of the Banks or the government of Nigeria. It is from this that I was persuaded to seek your permission to present this plan to you and you have given us the green light. It is only a proposal and I will not fail to inform you that this transaction, in it's simplicity, is totally free from risk of any kind whatsoever and nobody will be harmed in the process of it's  transfer. It will be between you and I that will decide whether or not to proceed with the transfer. Do as I tell you to and kindly come to the office to claim your share as I promised.

Samuel:

I am checking out the other conferences.  I find that William Cook (X-36409) and I have done  a poor job of staying in touch  so I may be bringing him along.  I actually brought him along with me to Brandon and he was happy to see  me again.  If you have not heard from me, don't be surprised if you do not hear from me  for awhile!  I have been  extremely difficult to keep up with and this has been especially  difficult on my end.  I started feeling really  unwell a few weeks ago and had some very bad news to tell you about.  I  wanted to write to you since you seemed to get a  lot of mileage out of my travel recommendations, but I thought maybe you would prefer to just save !

I wanted to start off by telling you how much I appreciate it.  Since I no longer travel, it has become more and more  important that I keep to myself.  I have always felt somewhat  invulnerable.  I have always felt like a outsider  - especially since I have had so many people question  and try to make assumptions about me.  I have always felt like a outsider  - especially since I have had so  many people try to make assumptions about me.  I wanted to make sure that I was doing everything I could to make  sure that I was meeting all of my social  expectations.  I wanted to be a person that everyone could  easily identify with.  I wanted to present a positive outlook on life and  believed in.  I wanted to change that perception.

So, how's it been?  You have been a pleasant surprise!  I  am very happy for you.  I really hope that you get to meet a lot of people.  You have helped to motivate me to get out there and experience life.  I have met a lot of people  who I think have a greater understanding of  what it is to be an ""average Joe"" than I do.  You have really  surprised me with your energy.  You have a great story to tell - should  I tell it?  It sounds like you have a lot of  fun traveling.  I sure enjoy having a few  days where I'm not constantly checking my email or checking out the new  Macleans.  Well worth the little travel.  It is  very  convenient to get around.  San Juan?"

Title: reply
 reply ATTN: The President/Director I am Mr.P.M. Jaco,Bank of Gold and Diamond Emporium , Presidents Road Branch , Lagos-Nigeria I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an America Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. John Moi made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$26,000,000.00(Twenty-six Million Dollars) upon maturity.Upon maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. John Moi died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. John Moi did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$26,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. John Moi so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/execution in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you payment in U.S. dollar or U.S. dollar-hydele. Please endeavor to reply immediately with your reply. If you are interested, please send me your direct email address for easy communication.Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality,and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Please send your reply through this email address:professionalkabongo@tiscali.co.uk Regards, Mr.P.M. Jaco

Title: ATTN.VERY IMPORTANT.
 ATTN.VERY IMPORTANT. Hello,  Let me start by introducing myself. I am Laurent Kabila  the  son of the late president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,Rapha-  amir Abacha. I was the Auditor General of Diamond Bank  before he died.  I was his personal lawyer and he entrusted my father's bank account  to me for safe keeping of the fund that his bank,Dion &amp;  other banks had deposited in the account.   After the death of my father, his personal lawyer, Mr. Aaron S. Kone,   made a numbered fixed deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at USD$25,000,000.00(Twenty  million dollars) in the account.  Upon maturity,  the bank sent a routine notification to me, but I  never got any response.   After a  year and a half, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered that  Mr. Aaron S. Kone  died in a plane crash on the 1st of November, 2000.   On further investigation, I found out that he died without  making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were  fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that  my father,  never- the less, deposited a fixed sum of $3,500,000.00(Three millions dollars)  in his personal bank account.   This sum of $3,500,000.00 was  discovered by me when I was still a  child and it remains  uncontrolled to this day.   This amount is  still  sitting in the account and the interest is  running  on  the   sum of the   money.   The banking  law and  guidelines here  prohibit a child below the  age  18 years; therefore,  my  purpose  in contacting you is  to                                         to     arrange for the transfer of this money to your account  for our mutual benefits.    I  cannot   write you a check, because I am a   woman; my pay grade is    not enough   for a woman to   write a Will; however,   I can  arrange for the issuance  of a WILL and obtain the necessary information   from the  probate office in favor of  the  transfer.    I will deliver to you the  bank account where the money will be  transferred to,   the  hospital where the money will be   transfered and the name of the  probate lawyer who will  act for the  person who will   inherit the    money.   I have  described  the   problem                           who will   inherit   the  money.   I will   arrange to travel to   the  bank   and        to       provide  the   bank  with   the necessary legal  documents  which will    :                         provide  the   bank  with  the   necessary legal  documents   which will   :                       THAT  _ DON'T RUIN THE  CASE   INVOLVED.   YOUR  URGENT RESPONSE IS NEEDED

Dear Laurent Kabila,  I am getting ready to send the letter to you and I need to find the address for you and your lawyer.  Can you give me a phone number for your lawyer?  Also, can you find the department to which you should send the letter?  This will  be the second time you have sent me a request to write a will.  Should I get a name and phone number for this  office, I will be able to find a lawyer near me.

A general rule of thumb would be, we would like to send the confirmation letter to the P.O. Box where we are currently licensed to do so, and the actual prepaid balance should be in the Appropriate Departmental Zone, with no spaces between departments.  This will usually be done on a form, or by checking off the boxes.

 Title: TREAT VERY CONFIDENTIAL &amp; URGENT RESPOND BACK
 TREAT VERY CONFIDENTIAL &amp; URGENT RESPOND BACK ATTN: Sir, I have a proposal for your support and cooperation. I got your contact from our chamber of commerce here in Nigeria after i prayed for God to bless me and my family.  I am Mr.Izzat Ali, an employee of the  Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation(NNPC). I am married with 3 kid's who was born in Nigeria. While i was working at the NNPC, we  discovered an excess of crude oil in my account, which we did not disclose to our management. This crude oil is the  equivalent of four months worth of oil in volume. The excess of this oil in my account has in our company treasury and we  are willing to part with most of the oil for corporate investment. However, after the assassination of our president on the 4th of  November 2002, we were informed that America government were going to cut off all ties  with the Sudanese, so we decided to transfer the excess money to foreign account which is why the money is being  being sent to you. From the account we discovered an account of one Mr.  Amadou Diop who died with his entire family on 25th of january 2003 in plane crash, and  the money has been with us in Nigeria since then. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it on account of  security reasons.  Now, with the death of our president on 25th of April, 2003, it's on the order of urgent to transfer the money  to any account which you will provide.  All modalities for fund transfer has been worked out for the fund to be  released within a maximum of 7 to 8 banking days.  Please be informed that there is the possibility of a very good return on investment when fully  transferred into your account. More so, you will be given 20% of the total amount, 60%  will be for me, while the remaining 10% will be for any expenses that  might be incurred during the process of transferring. Please, get in touch with me immediately through my private and  confidential email above, so that we can proceed  the transfer process.  Please, be rest assured that I have thoroughly discussed this  project with our bank director of around the same country and you will be  responsable for all further post-transfer expenses.  As soon as you confirm to me your readiness to proceed with this transactions, I will send to you  the information necessary for the transfer of this fund to any account in your  country.  Please, call me on telephone number 234-80-143463-9045(urad for more detail) for more  information.

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE
 URGENT ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I am Dr. Wolny Wolny, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining and Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Fourteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($15,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction. This amount $15.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $15.5m, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number or my e-mail address: wolny_olwany@yahoo.co.za or call me on my                                                                                        ; u.s.a                                              ;  +874-76-567-9802                                                                          ;                   ;               ;  (RE)FUNDS FOR CONTRACTS IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED

Dear Mr. Mohamed,

Thank you for your message. 2nd, 3rd and 4th of July are very important for us in the West. We will prepare for both. May I have your passport and you will send it to us. It should say ""Received by Enron - Mexico"" on the back. You will send it to me at my address below. I will then prepare a GISB for you and mail it to you. Do you have your friend's phone number?

Mr. White,

First and foremost, I want to thank you for your help. I had not realized how much of an asset to protect my friend Gabriella Kudacki.  She is a very bright and dedicated person.  I do not know about the other Goldman traders, but I would be more than grateful if you could protect her.  In addition to trading, Gabriella is a fairly intelligent and aggressive trader.  If there was ever a time that we could meet, please give me a call.  I am always available.

We have recently become acquainted and I want to report to you.  I am attaching my itinerary, so that you can contact me if necessary.  My phone number is 713-857-2271.

I do not anticipate you needing to contact me, but I do want to be prepared.

If you do, you will find me at the following address and time:

Gerald.C.Andersen@enron.com

My cell phone number is 713-857-5473

You may find me on the 504 The H

You may also find me on the Travel Channel's iCarly.  I am a frequent guest on Fast Company magazine's ""Fast Company"" People's Choice Awards shows and in the November/December issues of Rolling Stone magazine.

Title: ASSISTANCE NEEDED
 ASSISTANCE NEEDED Dear Sir, How are you and your family today? I am James Obi, the Auditor General in African developentment* (ADB) parent company to Gold &amp; Platinum c O Nigeria. I am writing to solicit your assistance in a business transaction that will be beneficial to both of our family at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in this parent company, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to one of our deceased customers who died with his entire family on July 30, 2000 in plane crash. After due verification and confirmations, the Banking &amp; Platinum c O Nigeria  c o n t the next step is that I and my colleagues, visited the account to ensure that the money is real and isn't a Ponzi/fraud money. On further investigation, it was  discovered that the customer who died,  also used the name James Obi  (my dad) as his next of kin and beneficiary of the account, it was also discovered  that the account is a no-go zone for a Nigerian because of the legacy of uncle olpe kabila who was murdered  in the land dispute in my country. So, I decided to do a business with you by offering you 10% of the total sum for your assistance. Note that the individual mentioned above  was a gold and diamond merchant, so any bank account in your country would do. I am not saying that you shouldn't or won't  apply for the account; I am just stating that you should be absolutely sure of your  eligibility before running this business with me. If you agree to my specifications, i will forward to you the necessary informations that will  put you in place as the beneficiary of this account.  Please,  do not entertain any fear as all the necessary informations will be put in place for  sure of the success of this project. I will be at your disposal to entertain any question from you.    Please, reply me immediately on my email box:obi_136@myway.com    Thanks and God bless,   Best regards,   james obi

Dear MR BEN JAJIC   Your post made me reflect on how I have been spending most of my time this year.  I am finding it more and more difficult to meet the demands of my business & personal life.  I decided to take a step back & take a deeper look at my options.  I found that I no longer needed to be involved with everyone.  I have found what I believe to be the right people for the job at hand & I can start to build a strong rapport with them.  I also found that my level of involvement with them has increased.  This has led me to believe that I can work with anyone here & I can even begin to formulate a strategy with them.  I really hope that my past work with them has given you some good ideas....if not, at least I can help you identify some positives.  As I mentioned to him, I am starting to think that maybe my level of involvement with him has been a little too high.  Maybe it is time to reassess that dynamic & move to a level that will work for both of you.  I am looking forward to talking to you & opportunity to prove myself to you.  Since I no longer see eye to eye with anyone else for the most part, I am starting to question whether or not I am making the right decisions.  Maybe it is time to reevaluate that dynamic & move to a level that will work for both of you.  I really hope that this dynamic is starting to subside....if not, at least I can offer some good advice.  If you are not ready to lose sight of what I will start to guide you.  in the best case of what I'm sure that I'm sure that I'll start to lose sight of you.

Title: From: Mr. Lee Kuan Yew
 From: Mr. Lee Kuan Yew ATTN:Sir/Madam,  I am Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank Singapore,21 km from here in Centre Island. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Singapore Oil Corp, Mr. David Ameeraly, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$14,800,000.00(ten million eight hundred and twenty four thousand dollars) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Singapore Oil Corp that Mr. David Ameeraly, died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below: &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; &lt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml&gt; On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly,illegally employed by the Singapore Oil Corp, died without a written or oral WILL.  This sum of US$14,800,000.00 and the interest it accrued on it Drained us both. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Ameeraly,illegally employed by the Singapore Oil Corp, and my late client Mr. I.M.A Adam, died alongside with his wife and only daughter at Cairo air crash (November 26, 1999) on their way to New York in a Boeing 767-200 for Christmas vacation. On further investigation, I found out that both these deceased persons were immigrants from Iran and had nothing to do with my country.This sum of US$14,800,000.00 and the interest it accrued on it Drained us both.  I therefore made further enquiries to trace any of these deceased persons next of kin but I was informed that all attempts to trace any of the deceased person's relations or next of kin was fruitless.  This is the reason why I prayed for you Mr.Lee Kuan Yew. Mr. Ziam Drissi, the Attorney to Mr. David Ameeraly and his family, advised that I should contact you so that you will act as the next of kin to the deceased person, so that you will be able to receive his funds.  I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as the beneficiary, 65% for me and my partners, and 10% will be set aside for expenses incured during the business.  I will be more pleased if you can assist us.  An interested person should send an e-mail to me, stating your interest, telephone and fax numbers.  Please, treat with the strictest confidentiality.  Yours sincerely, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.  From: Mr. Lee Kuan Yew.

Subject: Re: From Mr. Lee Kuan Yew

CTVNews.ca reports that the CEO of Suncor Energy Systems is canceling his trip to Calgary.  Instead, he will be flying to Perth and meeting with the State Board of Trade.  This is a big move for me personally.  Normally I would have approached you about this a long time ago, but now....I just don't feel like talking to you.  I really thought we would be able to make this deal....now

Michael Smith was instrumental in getting the deal done.  I think he is going to port the deal to Enron's West Asia Group.  I will send the completed form to you.

I also want to be clear about where I stand on the Kinder Morgan pipeline.  I support the Northern Gateway pipeline.  It is in the best interest of the Tar Sands to be integrated into the overall energy picture.  I do not support how it is currently configured.  It is something we can all get behind.

I will look forward to speaking with you.

Title: ATTENTION,
 ATTENTION, Dear Sir/Madam, Dear Sir, I am Mr.Gailu Fall, Bank of the Southeast Asia, in Abidjan, the capital city of Ivory coast in West Africa.I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On July 8, 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Burkinabe mining company, Mr. Phillip Morris made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, Valued at US$30,000,000.00( th e month) in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a  month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Burkinabe mining company Ltd that Mr. Phillip Morris died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Phillip Morris did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his  bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$30,000,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it According to Burkinabe law, at the expiration of (seven) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Burkinabe Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. My proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Phillip Morris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are immediately via this email I shall send you more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and regards, Mr.Gailu Fall.

Dear Victor,
  In the event that BMS is unable to make timely arrangements with your major trading partner, you may be eligible for consideration of a ""bench source"" trading arrangement.
  This is where one of our traders will park his or her car and allow others to park where they please.  It is important to note that this is not a rush, as arrangements can be made in as little as one day from when we receive the shipment to the home of the trader.
  The following information is as of 07/31/02 12:01 AM  PPT   EST:
                                     Subject:

Title: Profiling request
 Profiling request ATTN:The President/CEO  I am Dr. A. Nkomo, the Auditor General of the Airport Authority of South Africa(S.A. ). I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a Boeing 747-400, with passengers, cargo and/or crew on board, took off from Johannesburg, South Africa to fly to New York in America. We are not aware that we should worry about this as he (John Gunet) is an absolute trust worth emigration. When the 747-400 took off from Johannesburg, we were informed that all government entities had been notified and all banks and companies had been instructed to activate their banking/accounts as the affected parties and requested for their affairs to be under the control of a foreign firm. This is why I managed to get your contact details through the South African Chambers of Commerce and Industry. It is with hope that I write to inform you of this proposal I have been able to trace my father's bank account from its establishment in the late 1980s until his death. But on this note, I crave your indulgence and pray you forgive me for this indiscretion. But I am compelled to ask,  Have you considered for a moment that your income tax could be on the line if this money is not paid to my father’s bank account. Moreover, your account holds a total sum of US$25.5 million  in cash and your account has NO INHERITS. So your doing this for a man who has NO INHERITS and you do not want this money to go into your account. Furthermore, you are not entitled to receive this money in your account according to the South African Banking law. In short, my father was a very wealthy businessman and he did not declare any next of kin or relations in the banking rules.  I propose to you that if you are willing to entertain this and other benefits as a result of your hard work during the re-organization of his accounts, that you should contact me immediately through the above email address for further information.  I will give you the details of my bank, the branch where we are filing in and where the money will be transferred to.  Please, I want you to treat this proposal with utmost attention. Yours faithfully,  ALFORD  Nkomo. PLEASE PLS Send your response to adomas@oxfordonline.com

My number is 503-702-0463.

I was going to send you a confirmation and let you know that I changed my mind --- that is, I changed my mind to go to BC Place and cough up $20 to pay for my trip.  I thought I had figured out how to get to that part myself, but I'm guessing you didn't.

Apparently, I had miscalculated the cost of my trip.  I think I could have gotten a better rate by going to the city manager or contacting Kevin --- I just didn't know.

Anyways, I'm really sorry to miss your visit.  I had a blast!  Really nice weather, too.  I'm writing a book  and working on getting a Masters in International Relations.  It's an honor to be considered for the job.  I'm glad that you're still excited to learn more.  The more I learn, the calmer I get.

I am Heedurman M.M.M.M of the Mid- and West African development bank here in Dakar Senegal.I got your contact through my personal search when searching for an overseas reliable and trustworthy person to handle this important business in my bank.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 18.5million US dollars which our bank now bills as a foreign export transaction, which my head office kindly agrees to bill as such, but the actual amount was $18.5m dollars I had laying in an account I manage here in my bank before the expiry of the last imported contract, which contract we executed for our customers in Nigeria and abroad.As it may interest you to know, I got your contact through a family friend who works with the Mid- and West African development bank here in Dakar Senegal, who also happens to be a foreigner. As it may interest you also to know, my father was also a miner and we use this money to move our ancestral estates abroad for the investment of our youth in a safer and stable environment. As it may interest you to know that I was also a business man of mine, and my father was also a businessman, so we used this money to relocate to South Africa, in the hope of secure future for our children in life.As it may interest you also to know that no accidently, my father died without having any child round the heir apparent. Although he was poisoned by his own family members. This indeed is the case, and his younger brothers and sisters died without witness or any access to any male relative hence the amount of this money was paid as inheritances. And my mother died when I was a baby. I was therefore the only heir and I was poisoned by my own family members. As it may be, I must disclose this to you with believe in God that you will stand behind my decision and always be my guardian as I work on and my father's only child. May God bless you.

Dear hemdurman@mail2world.com,

Thank you for your response.

We have recently received the results of the internal affairs investigation.  The purpose of this investigation is to determine if there were any irregularities in the way that certain individuals were selected to fill key administrative roles in the Enron Group.

Based on the information that we have received so far, we are not in a position to fill any of the vacancies that we might have with respect to those individuals.

Therefore, we would like to obtain the following:

(i)   How long have you been working for Enron?

(ii)  Any qualifications that might be relevant to fill these vacancies.

(iii)  Whether or not we are able to relocate one or more of the individuals for the purpose of filling the vacant position.

We would like to obtain any salary information that may be relevant to fill these positions.

Any response that you provide will be made subject to our approval.

Thanks for your help.

Just wanted to know what the status is on the face-to face contact that we are about to sign.  I believe that we have outsourced this job for the foreseeable future.  Unless something changes soon, we will not receive an internal e-mail on the face of the contract.  Perhaps we will get a phone number.

On withdrawal, the bank sent a routine notification to me, but I never got any response.  After a  month, the bank sent another reminder and finally, we discovered from his contract  employers, the Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Johnnie Reilly died in the plane crash On October 31, 1999, (an Egyptian Boeing 767 Flight 990) with other passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:  http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.  I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Johnnie Reilly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$19,300,000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  The only available way for me to get this money is by applying for a visa on a visa versa, and I got your contact as a result of my investigation.  On this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as the next of kin to Mr. Johnnie Reilly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials.  The request of you as the next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that you have the same last name with Mr. Johnnie Reilly.  I am willing to give you 30% of the total funds,90% of which will be for me if you agree to be my partner.  If you are interested, kindly get back to me by:      You should also include your private fax and phone numbers including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.  Thanks and regards.  Mr. lucman Yengeni

Dear lucman_yengeni2@yahoo.co.uk, 
1.  You are wrong.  I am not trying to steal your identity.  I just wanted to know what was behind the screen name.  Do you have my social security #, date of birth, and/or driver license number if you have it?
2.  I don't have Johnnie's phone number on file, I forget it's there.  Just let me know!
3.  I don't even send birthday cards to known criminals!  This is for sure!  I'd like to know what he's like as a normal person!  Do you get ahold of him/her?
4.  I don't know if you received the note below from my dad,  but he's got some serious heart problems.  He's been out of town this whole time, and  apparently he had a heart attack last  weekend.  He's been out of town for about a week, and  I think he was out of town for about a month.  I don't know  what he was doing in Europe.  He probably was just  too busy freaking out.
5.  You might want to rethink that visit to  your dad, Jason and Michelle.  They are obsessed with spaceships and space.  They are the scariest people I have ever met.
6.  They really want to go to the beach.  If you want to go with them, you need to be there for a  phone conference.  Otherwise, they're going to the  beach party.  Which is fine with me.  Let me know.
7.  They really want to go to the library.  If you want to, you can bring  anything.  Just remember, they're spazzing out for different reasons, and you  need to be ready to learn.
If you decide to take those things into consideration, I think you'll find that you get a  lot of  value out of them.  The  biggest benefit I get out of having a plan in advance is that I can  easily set up a conference room for all of our group photos.  We can all show our family and ~everyone~  can see what we have up there.  No more guessing!
I am going to sell everything I can and start over in about two weeks, but I'm going to get a  a > real job offer sheet > and start looking to negotiate. > with people that in case

Dear Vince:

I am writing to inform you that my contact at  Enron is Dave Reicher, and his phone number is  1-800-684-1336.  I do not have a previous owner/manager relationship with  Dave Reicher, so I can't  write to confirm that he's still involved. However, as you  mentioned to me, you brought along with you a completed  statement of your intentions to become fully integrated into the  Enron family.  This is what you should bring with you to Enron HQ in  Houston, as we are planning to move our main office there in early next week. Can you also send me a copy  of your completed statement of your intentions to become fully integrated into the Enron family?  If you're not  ready to submit this to Enron, that's okay. I can still send you a  copy when I get it to me.

I'll be glad when I get back from India, but if not, then I can send it to Dave Reicher.  

Many thanks!

Title: Re: Re: RE: BUSINESS PROPOSAL

I think that we have a company that is the proper name to deal with here in TX.  It is not a legal/chartered company, but rather, we are selling the electricity that comes directly from the generating units.  This is typically done through brokers.  There are several power companies that we are dealing with, and I'm sure that you will be able to provide us with the name of one or more of the major utilities.  This is the second opportunity that we have had to deal with this type of thing, and we thought that we would be able to deal with this ourselves.

We just left a voicemail for Larry King, and he said that he couldn't find anything wrong with the transaction.  He is the one doing the back-up work, so it should be pretty obvious how the system is set up.  All we are asking for is that it is reported to the proper authority (the FERC form, if you will) so that we can put a stop to any regulatory issues.

We are also asking for any authority that might be involved with the transaction to make the appropriate disclosures, i.e. who exactly is managing the generating units and what is the scope of their responsibilities.

This is generally where the real work takes place, i.e. when things start to get serious.  These kinds of deals are supposed to be completed by the end of the year, and there are supposed to be no issues.  The truth is that there have been a couple of hiccups along the way, and we have had our share of them.  We are just hoping that something will turn up to clear up any issues, and we will soon be able to move into actual day-to-day operation.

If there are any outstanding issues, please let me know, and I will return the favor by providing you with a solution.  I don't think there are any outstanding issues with the Energy Finance  (i.e. price-to-volume) aspect of the deal, either.  I'm just doing my due diligence here, and giving you the best advice I can.

Thanks,

anonymous

I am TD Amery, the manager in charge of Auditing and Accounting  departments in  the Bank of Africa (Ouagadougou).  I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On  smooth conclusion of a foreign contract award which was recently concluded by  our National Electric Power Authority here in  Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm,  with the Consignment Data Form (CDF) musters, by the  National Electric Power Authority (N.E.P.A) to supply power to  households which are not thermostat controlled.  The contract was over invoiced by us and the of the Contract was awarded.  But the contract has since been cancelled and the contract is not  over invoiced, rather it has been awarded on the understanding that we will allow the  financing company to continue to pay us the difference between the actual contract  sum and the sum owing us by the contractors, it is because of this  that I got your contact.  I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in  the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will treat this  transaction with utmost attention.  I am writing because I want my bank account to be credited with  the total sum of (US$75, 000,000.00) WHICH is the actual contract sum  when actual contract have been awarded. Thereby to  enable the transfer of this fund to any foreign account you will nominate. As  I have expressed my wish to transfer to a foreign account, I do hereby seek your assistance in  enabling our bank account to be remitted.  I have secured from our bank a solution whereby the money can be  be transferred without any hitch.  To give you more information about this transaction, I got your  contact from our chamber of commerce, I will not fail to introduce that you should not entertain any fear because  your person is the medico-legal owner of the account and the Account was  secured with a security company before it was sent to your account.  Myself and my partner are in our late thirties and we are young. We are academics and  we have not done any banking before we came to your country.  This is our first account in your country and we intend to look  for a foreign account after this project.  We are not going to upset anyone in the bank but please treat this  as top secret and confidential.  If you are willing to assist us, contact me immediately through email  account@qatar.net Thank you and God bless,  Regards,  Dr. Amer Musa. _________________________________________________________ Gagne une  présentation du PC au PC! http://www.cnet.fr/

Mr.Alfred,

I feel I must speak to you about this.  I am concerned about what will happen if we do not get this all set  up.  I have been re-directing your staff to go through the steps  to fill out the required paperwork.  This included getting all the required documentation  for our wire services, as well as completing the required research  and paying the required  fees.

I am concerned that if we do not get these things finished in time, or if we attempt to rush the process,  that we will not be able to go through the additional steps  that we need to take to make sure that the information is being  collected and stored in a timely manner.  

I have been making every effort to expedite as possible, and to ensure that all the required documents are  being handled in accordance with the law.  I  am trying to minimize the time it takes to get to the  conclusion that we are going to have to reach regarding certain aspects of the  transaction.  We are going to have to make some tough decisions regarding who is eligible to  have certain types of documents mailed to him.  Are we going to mail him the  required paperwork himself, or are we going to send it to a P.O. Box?  It is possible that we will decide to mail it to the  address of his choosing, but if that is the  decision that you would like to make, please let me know.  I am trying to accomplish as much as possible  quickly as possible, and if you can delay  the mail submission process until we can mail the necessary documents, that would  be fine.  We will mail the required paperwork on Thursday, and the rest of the things should be  addressed to him.

I am forwarding you a phone number where I can be reached for further information.  If you do not want to wait, you can call me at my cell phone number is (503) 757-7998.

Once again we appreciate your help, and look forward to talking to you on Thursday.

Title: INVESTMENT CONSULTATION TO MY NAME
 INVESTMENT CONSULTATION TO MY NAME Dear Sir,   My name is Dr. Simeon Apple, the auditor general of  Central Bank of Nigeria. I write you in respect of an account that  might interest you. It may interest you as well to know that I was the account officer to  the deputy chief air traffic controller of Abuja Air Traffic Control  not far from here in Lagos who was involved in an air crash. The accident occurred on the 23rd  of April 2000. while on transit to Dakar Senegal. Below is a picture taken by my  colleague while we are on duty. It is a frame from an Italian news agency but you can  verify it is real by going to news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since then I have made several inquires to trace the relation of Mr. and Mrs. David Ingrams to the  incident but to no avail. It is because of the uncertainty of knowing the real owner of the funds that the  government of Nigeria has made arrangement in the European campaign to track the fund to any of the 204 accountants that the government has told my  colleague and myself to look for any of his next of kin. Having investigated further into the matter, I found out that Mr. and Mrs. David Ingrams died without a Will but they may have left behind some of their fund with a security firm in  Europe. These funds are some of millions of dollars that have been floating around for some years now. It is not clear to me which accountants are still holding the funds for the government. I would like to know now how much of the funds remain in the account of the government and which is being controlled by me now and later in the year. If it is not, I will request that the government should release the funds to me. If this transaction is not acceptable to you, then kindly, I beg you in the Name of God Almighty, inform me on his e-mail address so that I will explain to you what to do. I shall apply the appropriate channels of contact to reach you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, Dr. Apple

 VERY URGENT REPLY NEEDED PLEASE. FROM: Rev. Gregory M. Lee LAGOS-NIGERIA. Dear Friend,                                (rev_greg_lee.)                                          (rev_greg_lee) I was born in Lagos, is now living in Nigeria, and was the second of three children. My father was the first and only Baptist pastor of our church in the city of Lagos, who died in the year 2000. Before his death on 1st September 2002, my mother died while she was giving birth to my father's second child. My father deposited the sum of $15.5million (FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security company in Cotonou, Benin.After the death of my father, I went to my father's home country of Benin to seek for a reliable foreigner to stand as my guardian and next of kin to my mother. He told me that in a few days, he will re-marry with his first wife and they will both reach the age of 60. I then sought for an intercountry partner to carry out the business with me and partner abroad.As soon as I accepted his offer, I started by getting in touch with a security company and arranging the banking and financial details on how the money will be secured into an account in your name. Then I sent a copy of the contract between me and the company to your name so that you will prepare the documents and letter of application. Finally, I told you where I kept my share (50.5%) and what percentage (25%) will be for my own protection. I told you that 75% (25%) will be for you. I will give you a further 25% on all contingencies as you may consider in your private Chambers. I remain, Sincerely, Rev. Gregory M. Lee. ____________________________________________________________ Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329

Title: TRANSFER OF ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS)
 TRANSFER OF ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) Dear Sir, With Due Regard I wish to Apology and Request for Assistance in this matter. I am a staff in the Accountant General of Nigeria (A.G.) with the rank of assistant to the president of the A.G. Late Mr. General Sani Abacha the head of state. I was on duty on the 11th of April 2002 when my boss, my boss came down to Mobile from a trip to Trinidad and Tobago where he was having a private meeting with some African leaders where he made a lot of political patronage deal. At the meeting, he made a deal with one of the leaders that if he is reelected President of Nigeria next year, he will give him (my boss) the sum of ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) for every job he does while in office. As the president of the A.G. now, he knows that he will get this money from time to time when he is in the country. As soon as the money was conveyed to my boss office, he called me on his bed side and told me that he has the money in his vault. I then proceeded to the vault and found the sum of ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) in there with the papers of my boss. I demanded where my boss got the money from and he told me that he deposited the sum of ($10.5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS) with a security company in Europe. I then contacted the Nigeria International Development Co-operation (N.IDC) whose chairperson is Mr. Rashid Aloane. He told me that he will kindly give me the necessary information and direction to the security company where the rest of the money is being kept now. That was how we were able to locate the said security company. We will be coming over to Nigeria in due course, after we have processed all the paperwork and are give us the necessary directions. Please, treat with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. I hope that this proposal-offering-and-promotion-from-your-particular-of-your-interest-gets-agreed-with-you-as-soon-as-possible. Again, I await your urgent reply- Beloved in Christ, MRS. SUSAN F. KABILA. Disclaimer: This e-mail is 100% legitimate.

Briefly, the above transaction (transfer of $10,5  MILLION from one account to the other) has been confirmed by the relevant financial  authorities in Europe.  As I mentioned earlier, this transaction is subject to  the clearing process and all pertinent conditions. I have  no reason to believe that this transaction is in error as it was approved on  Sunday (10/16/01).  It is necessary to transfer the money at that time.   Thanks, Chris

I  am looking for the attached message from you in my report (Cc: Nikhil, Arora, Ruchirakshana, Suresh and others).  If the attached is what you are looking for, I  can send it to the relevant person in the UK immediately, for your  e-mail and to cover a week in India.  If not, I  will be back in London next Monday m - f to help you review the relevant e-mails etc.  It will  allow me to review the evidence, to learn from,  review, and validate what you already  have, etc.  This is also my second visit to India, the first part of an  extended  two week tour.  This trip will continue as I have done before, in the US.  There are  many more e-mails that I have received and reviewed, but this is the most  relevant as it pertains to my current  situation in India.

Dear Prof. Edwin Pau:
 
I was under the impression that you are an attorney in the Southern District of Texas.  I was wrong.  In fact, I am a non-practicing associate of Baker & McKenzie (B & K).

I would like to stress that you are not required to hire me as a lawyer by contract, since I can practice my law or, as you understand it, ""do what I please"".  Also, I can testify on my  clients' behalf in these matters.

Yours,

Dear Smrke:

After reviewing the information in the latest health and welfare reports, such as  I am no longer receiving these weekly reports.  I am  left here to determine who to inform for whom to contact  and who to contact for whom this health concern concerns  pertains.  It is also important to recognize that many of the health  and welfare reports from Enron were submitted by parties that do not control  all healthcare providers in their areas.    To make matters worse, health and welfare reports are still being accepted  by the Health and Environmental  Services of PHI.  I am hoping that this health care concern is not being discussed on  the committee at full committee  meetings.   Thank you for taking time out of your  busy schedules to review the latest  health and welfare reports.   Sincerely  looking forward to your report on Health  and Energy in the next few  weeks.

PLANE CRASH WEB SITE...http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm.                (""ROBUST"") I AM MR.RASHMUKHA MY NAME IS JERRY NAIYUNMUKHA FROM WEST AFRICA. I WORKED WITH THE AFRICAN  DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB) OUAGADOU-BURKINA FASO IN WEST AFRICA. WE HANDLE ALL OVER THE WORLD BANKING EXCHANGE AND OTHER NECESSARY FUNDS  FOR BUSINESS OF ALL NATURE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS SETTLEMENTS IN THE BANK AND WE NEVER KNOW OUR MOST NEEDED CONTRACTS ARE NOT IN THEIR SETTLEMENTS. ONCE THERE WAS AN ISSUE IN ONE OF MY OFFSHORE OFFICE THERE WAS AN ONGOING CONTRACT PROCESS WHERE SOME FOREIGN PARTNERS WERE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE THEIR CONTRACT. DURING THE COURSE OF THE WORKING DAY, SOME FOREIGN PARTNERS WERE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE THEIR CONTRACT FROM THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB) OUAGADOU-BURKINA FASO. AND SOME WERE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE THEIR CONTRACT FORM FROM THE BANK. AND ALONG WITH THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT FOR THE COMPLETE DISBURSEMENT PURPOSE OF THE FUNDS, THE COUNCIL OF MINISTRY OF WORKS AND HOUSING MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO OVER-INVOIC THE REMAINING FUNDS TO BE USED FOR THE OVER-INVOICEMENT PURPOSE. AND THE OVER-INVOICED FUNDS ARE NOW IN THE CARE OF THE FOREIGN PARTNERS. WE HAVE SINCE THEN BEEN GOING THROUGH THE RESOURCES TO DETERMINE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE LEARNT THAT ALL HIS SUPPOSED NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION DIED ALONGSIDE WITH HIM AT THE PLANE CRASH. IT IS AS SUCH, WE HAVE DECIDED TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS PROPOSAL AND INVEST THE TOTAL SUM OF US$7,500,000.00 INTO SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD TO ENABLE US KEEP SOME FOREIGN FUNDS FOR OUR INVESTMENT PURPOSE. THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS (US$7.500,000.00) FIFTEEN-MILLION U.S DOLLARS. THE DATA CONTAINS THE CONTENT OF THE CONSIGNMENT. ACCORDING TO THE PERCENTAGE INDICATED, THE AMOUNT TOTHERETHIS IS (US$7,500,000.00) (SINCE NOBODY HAS OPERATED ON THIS CUSTOMER'S CONTRACT), TOTAL AMOUNT OF (US$7,500,000.00) FIFTEEN MILLION U.S DOLLARS WILL BE REMITTED INTO THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNT AS UNCLAIMED FUNDS. THERE AFTER, WE WILL TRANSFER THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO OUR BANK ACCOUNT FOR SAFE INVESTMENT. TO ENABLE US KEEP THE MONEY THERE, WE WILL NEED YOUR ACCEPTANCE. YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 40% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT WHILE 10% WILL BE FOR SUBSEQUENT EXPENSES. WE BOTH PARTNERS WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU THEIR PERSONAL CO-OPERATION TO ENABLE US SEE THIS MONEY LEAVE THE BANK FOR SAFE PURPOSE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED THAT THIS BUSINESS IS HIGH RISK. WE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT YOU'RE NOT SAFE FROM THE BANK'S OWN GOVERNMENT TROOPARDIES. TO FURTHER ENABLE US KEEP THIS MONEY, WE REQUIRE YOU TO KEEP YOUR PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS SINCE WE ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR INFORMATION WOULD BE PROTECTED BY A SECURITY COMPANY HERE IN IN THE U.K. WHICH YOU WILL BE REMITTED INTO FOR SECURITY PURPOSES. WHICH I WILL GIVE

You really suck at your job. This is only my 2 cents.  I'm sure you can  hear all the other employees in the building and  hear us from all over the
 world.  You  can't  read and I am not a technical expert on the 
 Internet or a network engineer. I can 
 read it and it doesn't make any sense to me.  How is 
 you supposed to talk to us about our product as 
 we have no idea about network 
 management? 
 
 I'll call right away to discuss  
 things further with the CMO.

Dear Mr. Wuongliao,
 1.  As mentioned, the two articles were good but the first one was a bit late.   However, I think I've already had a second opinion and it was much better than the first.
 2.  It sounds interesting and interesting!  I will have to check it out on October 21.  I also heard that the Lehman Brothers IPO event is coming right up.   We have not decided who we will invite to this one and who we will invite to those talks.  Who do you anticipate going?

Title: TRUST REQUEST
 TRUST REQUEST Dear Sir, TRUST REQUEST. TRUST REQUEST. I am Mr.James M Thompson, a lawyer. I am a solicitor licensed in Lagos State of Nigeria. I was a private lawyer to the elder R. R. Thompson the present Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy under the President of Nigeria  who is also my client and current position as a lawyer in Lagos State of Nigeria. There were some big problems on the 21st of May 2000 when the then current President of the Federal Republic Of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha, made a decree to allocate funds to all the national and International organizations who are credited with remedying the messes caused by the former President of Nigeria Gen. Sani Abacha. All funds, will be shared according to the percentages indicated. The funds were allocated to various agencies and departments of the federal government and National  International Cooperation Bureau in the form of grant. This decree has actually been in force since then and the people of Nigeria know very well that there are alot of grants being procured by foreign contractors for various projects. In order to avoid this, before I got the information about your email to contact you, I had to verify if you are able to handle such amount of funds. Based on the amount of $372 Million US Dollars which I had in my custody, I now decide to disclose the actual sum to you as regards to your honesty and trust. As regards to the program and the actual funds, I have to leave space in the above quoted sum for any form of accounting errors or omissions, which I will admit when I hear from you. My position as the lawyer in this matter now is that you can only contact me through my honest attorney in Lagos who is presently staying here in Lagos, who has the necessary legal documents which I will provide to you, and I will depend on you to be able to present yourself as the rightful next of kin of the fund. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% safe and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangement has been made for the execution of the transaction. You should contact me as soon as you receive this mail. I am waiting for your reply through my email address. This transaction should last for at least 6 months from the date of receipt of the following information through my email address: Your full name, Your private/company's email and phone numbers.                          Please, treat with utmost confidentiality and strictest confidentiality as you would wish. This transaction is 100% risk free. You can also contact my private attorney at and we will discuss in detail. Regards, James M Thompson Director personal law services, Domestic and International Affairs, Lagos State of Nigeria.

Dear James,

I think that I speak for myself when I say that I've  been successful with TRUST issues.  Please keep in mind that I have  been   working on the  problem for three years.  It is a problem I have had over the years since  the advent of the Internet. 

A quick search on TRUST on the Internet will turn up a number of 
 successful transactions which I believe were conducted on   July 1999 

- the  first day that they
 allowed the  trading day. 

Please call if you have any questions or 
 you are interested.  (713) 951-8356.

Dear Mr. Jay McIver,

We have recently installed a new video system,   which will enable us to post more quickly and accurately.

We shall call you tonight  to discuss which version of the program you will need.

Thanks,

D&Y

The video server now has a bandwidth of 150Mbps/150 Mbps and we will post in the middle of the video  sequence.

Please note the  video version is only available to those having a  subscription.

http://www.imlink.com is no longer able to access the web  interface for the upgrade.

The video server now has a bandwidth of 150 Mbps/150 Mbps and will  post in front of the video segment, although it  still has the capacity to post at the last minute  or even post in the middle of the video segment.

Please let others know if you   plan to post online this evening.  As always this  will be a much better package for you.

Please let us know if you have questions   or if you need   more space for your video login.

Thanks.

D&Y

The video server no longer is capable of running the     full video streaming feature at this speed.

Please remove the current video stream if  you do not plan on posting.

Dear Dr.Ikuo Ogawa

The business proposal letter you have just provided to  Enron is a proposed business proposal letter which Enron and its executives will  use on this proposal to present to the World Exporters' Business Council.

In summary, the business proposal letter should state the market  position and  name of Enron Corp, the position the company itself is proposing and  the position of the positions of the companies mentioned.

Dear suhaib mohameed:     Thank you for your kind e-mail.  It means alot to me seeing how you are working for a major oil company and how you 
 are aware of what happened.  I would imagine that the majority of the people affected are 
 not in the oil and gas industries but rather the small traders doing deals on the fringes of 
 energy.   It brings back memories of my school days as I would 
  be working on a project with a certain person and a good friend of mine in 
 the last 12 months and how we would work on projects at various levels of 
 development. We would be in charge of the infrastructure and the person is 
 known as the president.  He would have ultimate discretion in the 
 person he decided to work for and would be responsible for 
 the  management side and overall business development.  I will take care of      all the rest of the people with input/inputs and     will take care of your project too.     Thank you very much for the    time you have spent with me so far.      Let me know if you need any help with any   subject, or if you have any questions.     Best regards. Regards.

 URGENT REPLY NEEDED!! MR. SPEARL MARTINS BANK OF AFRICA. OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA FASO. Reply me here first. Email address:spearlmartinsbkofa@indiatimes.com Dear friend, It is a pity that I must not be able to visit you and offer you  my friendship and regard. I am a citizen of Burkina Faso who currently resides in  Senegal. I am married to Dr. Marion Martins who is the head of  audit department of the bank. He is the only son of late Mr. Laurent Stephen Martins a former  minister in the former president of Burkina Faso, who was a member of that country's top  decision making body, the Cotonou-Senegal high commission. You can verify this from the website  which I kindly obtained from a reliable source: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Since his departure from office, I have been pursued by the military junta of President Blaise Compaor to source for a reliable foreign partner to handle  all my offshore and foreign  account details so that we can transfer and release the sum of $7.5million dollars to your account once the problem has been  cleared up. To avoid any accident or misunderstanding, all we require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. We have agreed that 30% of this money will go to you for your assistance in clearing all  necessary documents and signature/issuance for transfer of the money. 10% will go to any expenses incurred in the process of transfer. 5% (seventeen percent) will be set aside for all expenses as incurred during the process of transfer. We have likewise agreed that 70% should be for me.As soon as this fund gets into your account, you will be connected  to the process of transfer.  Please, be honest to me as soon as possible. I look forward to your prompt reply. Regards, SPEARL MARTINS BANK OF AFRICA

 TREAT AS URGENT PLEASE FROM: elia baki 15/2/2005 ATTN: President Dear sir, I am Mr. elia baki the manager of bush trust in Nigeria. I found your contact address in my search for a partner and I decided to contact you for this business deal. The fund (US$15.4M) in question is Central bank(CB) currency tender. As a matter of fact, this tender has been running for some time now and as at the end of January 2004 the current tender value of the current tender, being made by Central bank(CB) to an oil company in Nigeria and the date of receipt of the materials to be used in the un-tender from the oil company in Nigeria, was February 12, 2003. And the un-tender was finally cancelled on February 19, 2004. I have therefore decided to solicit for your assistance to present you as the director of operations of a company whose shareholders are Mr. and Mrs. Cyril John, the former Prime Ministers of Liberia and Sierra Leone, respectively. I will provide the necessary business documents and proofs to claim the fund from the Central bank and legally transfer it into your custody account pending my arrival in your country. I will however, require your full co-operation to bring this deal to an end. Ltd. 2%   increase in my salary will constitute 40% of the total sum. Please kindly contact me as soon as possible on my private email address; elia_baki@yahoo.com. Please also as soon as you are ready to conclude the transfer of this money to your custody account, we shall discuss on how to share the rest. Kindly you should treat with this email. Please look forward to your urgent response. Yours sincerely, Mr. elia baki. Nominated by elia baki ad-Dah.

1) name of your store;

2) name of your customer, such as 
 'Luis Martinez' or 
 
 'Sergio de la Lleida' or 
 
 'Luis Rodríguez' or 
 
 'Diofilo de la Calc. Calc. de Cienfuegos'   
 
 
 
 
 I will call you later this week or early next week to discuss with you the details of the transaction
 at the rate of 2-3 business days at 
 least 
 from what you got  
 from the trader in the box  
 question for the trade in the package (as we will be  
 having the courier, we need to know  
 who to  
 pick up).  
 
 
 
 
 We would appreciate if

The customer has already paid and the balance is due by the end of monday (15  
 June).  So, he didn't pay  it until thursday  (9th, so he could take our invoice  
 or pay on thursday  (15th).   I think the only solution would be to  get the bill paid on friday (18   
 June).  I'm not sure what they will say about it when the account  
 was frozen   because of this but the bill is ready

Title: OBITUDE
 OBITUDE FROM KJOS PHOENIX BANK OF AFRICA (BOA). OUAGADOU-BURKINA FASO. DESK/PRIVATE  Email:kjoseph@yahoo.com Dear Friend, It is my pleasure to write to you, and it's a very good one, I am a staff in the accounts management section of BOA , a well-known bank here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso-West Africa. We had an account with holding balance of US$10,000,000 .00 (Ten Million United States Dollars) which we intend to withdraw the sum of ($10,000,000.00) from the bank for proper disbursement. The owner of the account a foreigner by name James Anderson died since 1995. Before his death he deposited some amount of money (US$10,000,000.00) in a security company in Europe, which we are yet to receive a single payment from the government of Burkina Faso. and  we have no way of knowing that someone else will come along and claim this money from the government and claim it, since we cannot really trace our ancestors. I am prepared to enter into a joint business venture with you to claim the money and share it with me. As I am a staff in the bank  management I will negotiate the modalities for a successful conclusion of this transaction. What we desire from you is assurance that you will receive at least 50% of the total amount of $10,000,000.00 after we have processed your accounts. As soon as I confirm your readiness to conclude the transaction with me, I will furnish you with the details. Please treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality and confidentiality as our only customer is of paramount importance. You may also send me your confidential telephone and fax number to enable me reach you at any time. Again, this transaction requires absolute confidentiality, as all modalities for a successful conclusion of this transaction has been negotiated. Please treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality and confidentiality as our only customer is of paramount importance. Send your reply to kjoseph@yahoo.com Enjoyed your reply?

Dear Dr. W.H.S. ARAF:      You have been recommended to me by the C.E.O. of Enron Corp., Jeffrey R. Lowney, as being an authority on banking regulation in the United States.  I was interested in learning from you and your associates (those of you who were in the    previous position) on some of the regulatory issues and    issues arising within our industry and the regulatory oversight that the C.E.O.    proposed to me in his written   testimony (see Exhibit 1 below).  I was hoping that we could discuss in greater   detail what he has suggested, and perhaps   he would be  able to informally clarify   you of what you have said.  I   therefore would request that your time be ""reached""   on Monday, April 12th, and that you ""give me   a copy of any comments he has 
 to this effect, and   I have   the opportunity to ask you during today's meeting.""  I   think this is the right time to take some time to    review his proposed comments as they relate to the   C.E.O.   Comments are also a good time to look at the SEC   comments on his proposed   testimony.   I  do not think we   need to rush him on this.  I agree with both you and the C.E.O. that there is a    good case to make regarding the C.E.O.'s role in setting financial   standards for investment banking operations.  We will   also discuss in greater detail with regard to his role in   regulating the   emerging  industry that has emerged since he left the Enron- 
 bank.     Regards,   Abdul  <abur9857-907e-b964-11c5-e040a0022e70e@mail.utexas.edu>

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER, AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO. WALTER ALSINA BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER, AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO. WEBSITE:www.doba.com.my Dear, I am Mr.Walter Alsina the Manager of Bills and Exchangers at the African Development Bank (ADB). I write to seek your assistance to transfer out US$8.5MILLION (EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND US DOLLARS) from our foreign customer(s) account. It may interest you to know that my late client was the former Minister of Mines under the former Government of Mr. Laurent Desire. You shall read more about this case on the web site below: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm Before my late client left office he made a fixed deposit for 12 calendar months, with an opening balance of US$12,500,000.00 with the ADB. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during his last months in office as the Minister. On the maturity date another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We got your phone contact from the database. According to the banking law and guidelines, the bank is allowed to require a third party to stand as next of kin to the account owner if the account owner is incapable of transferring the fund. Since the bank cannot compel any more from him, we have made a proposal to transfer the fund to a private firm on his behalf which shall file the necessary paperwork to the ADB and the UK Home Office. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to use this fund to finance the importation of agricultural machinery and chemicals to our country. We have all the documents in our possession to back up any claim we may make. All we need from you is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. We have decided in favour of sharing this funds with you, if you agree to arbitrate. For your partnership you will be entitled to 30% of the funds while 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties may incur during the transaction. Please treat strictly as top secret and do not divulge the contents of this email to anyone. Please, you can contact me through my email address below or through the email address's above. Please, treat as absolute top secrecy and do not divulge the contents of this email to anyone.  This transaction is 100% risk free. Finally, I wish to inform you that the conditions for this transaction being concluded is because of your simple and 5 star review of the website. Please contact me through this email address for more information on the transaction.

Title: PLEASE ASSIST
 PLEASE ASSIST I am Mr. Jim K, the Auditor General of  CITIC. I wrote to you as a person of integrity not to get involved in the matter of a foreigner depositing account with us. As someone who has worked with some of the most prestigious banks and financial institutions in the world I am well aware of the difficulties involved in tracking down the next of kin of an account holder of large amount of money. This is especially the case with accounts over a certain amount of money which often exceed the stated sum in question. In many cases the account holder has passed away leaving nobody behind for claiming the money. In these cases, I have been appointed as the next of kin to claim the funds and this is by  Contract of office. Accordingly, I will demand for  your assistance to present you as the next of kin of the account holder so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to you. On your willingness to work with me on this transaction,I  will contract attorney to produce the documentations and application for claim. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine and successful. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. You cannot afford to sit on this money when it is claimed. If you are interested, reply immediately via my email address; i have urgent fax number and a short time to give you the chance to reply. Upon your response,we shall then proceed to the next step including the application form for this transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this process will be under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

 URGENT AND SINCERE ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I am Mr. Dawud Abacha the eldest son of the former head of state Mr. Motse Edema of Sierra Leone. My late father was falsely accused of murder and had his head chopped off by the Sierra Leone military. My mother died when I was just 2 years old and since then my father took me so special. Before the death of my father on the 18th of February 2002 in a hospital here in the U. A. E. he secretly called my attention to a sum of money that he claimed was the sum of $15,000,000 million (Fifteen million united states dollars)and gave me the instructions to look for a reliable foreigner to assist in this transaction. He also told me that he can sue in court for the money if he wants to, and he also claimed that he has the ability to bring out the money from the vault here in here in the U. A. E. He also told me that he can sue in the press for the word ""BUSH"" to be used in the course of the transaction. He also insisted that I should use my position and influence to enforce compliance with the laws and regulations of the country I now intend to move to. He also told me that the reason why he was never tried for the murder of my mother was that the government of Sierra Leone does not believe that he is capable of carrying out such a heinous crime. He also told me that he had secretly cleared the money from the file of the finance firm where he worked.He also told me that he has all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim he may make. He also insisted that he use my name as the lawyer,sources of which he also gave me. I am contacting you because I want you to stand as the beneficiary of the funds and have your name used in place of my mother's when you are ready to execute the claim. He also demanded that you ""show me your cards"" for confirmation that you are capable of executing the claim. If you are willing to assist me I will disclose to you the details concerning the rights of the transaction. I will also give you 30% of the funds. Please, contact me as soon as possible on my private e-mail address:dawudbaki@yahoo.com. For your reliable assistance, we are asking for 35% of the money while we are waiting for your response. If you are interested, please reply to this message indicating your availability. We await your response to enable us conclude the transaction as soon as possible. Thanks for your anticipated response. Sincerely, Mr.    Dawud Abacha.

Title: From Mr. JAYSH dhuchi
 From Mr. JAYSH dhuchi Dear Sir, Good day to you. My name is Mr. JAYSH dhuchi from Palestine, Palestine. I am the accountant general of a bank here in Palestine. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On May 12, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Government of  Iraq, Mr. Bassem Youssef who was based in Kuwait, flew to Kuwait to  visit his daughter. While in Kuwait, Mr. Bassem lodged an application for a Temporary Resident permit with the Embassy's  Office. On further investigation, it was  discovered that Mr. Bassem had no family or relations in Kuwait. The Embassy's office at the time of filing advised him of his inability to operate a  foreign account and will confiscate any such account at the expiration of 5 (five) years. The situation became more and more desperate as no other person knew about these accounts or any thing concerning them, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved it to be false. It is more than likely that this account is standing as the beneficiary of the late Mr. Basem Youssef who was a Foreign Oil Merchant/Contractor with the Iraqi Ministry of the petroleum Resources and Fuels. You shall read more about the Youssef family and the Youssef tragedy by visiting this website: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;vsms=cite&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;emc=islink&amp;amp;lt;lt;lul=http://www.pci.bar.ca.us/pcibarca/j/josephy5.html&amp;gt; please, send me your reply through this email address: jayeshdutch@netscape.net Please, kindly provide me the following informations to enable me start the process of our business: 1) Full Name. 2) Full Contact Address. 3) Mobile or Mobile PRIVATE phone and/or fax numbers. 4) Full Name for your country. I will need your full name and address so that I can use your name as the beneficiary to the account, or you may apply for it. After your full contact address and name, your contact address will be assigned so that your account manager will prepare an application and send it to you for your independent verification. I will use my position, influence and influence to effect the necessary arrangement for the transfer of the money to your original bank account in your country. The transfer is 100% secure, and the amount in question is (USD $10.5 MILLION DOLLARS). If you are interested, please reply via this email address:jayeshdutch@netscape.net and include your private phone and/or fax numbers, and your full private phone/fax numbers for quick communication. My position as the account manager of this customer interests me the most, and I have decided to contact you for your assistance. Your suggested compensation for your assistance is (USD $5.5 MILLION DOLLARS) light blue checkmark. Please consider the seriousness of this business and move quickly.  Please keep this business proposal very confidential and do not disclose the nature of this transaction to anyone. Yours sincerely, Mr. JAYSH DHUSSI. ____________________________________________________________ Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329

Dear jaysh dhuchi :  

Thanks for the message about      being at The Meadows this     morning. I was sitting in     around the corner from where Mr.    Ayer is being housed in the new home. It was good    to hear from you.         If we can   go out and try to do something, let me know.     The    pleasure     being on one of these other      dates is that I could   go ""home"" and feel free and     free to roam the whole day.    If so, maybe it will be for a bit of fun?     It will make me happy if we     meet  at one location...perhaps     at a   barbecue or     something else     that is appropriate    for a ""sporting day."" 

Vendor-  What are the  
   rates? (USD per  > megawatt-hour - that is the cost of   an equivalent of 5.5 
 megawatt (MWh) of energy produced equivalent energy - that is 5. 
 $10 cheaper for the energy that amount versus $5.5 for the energy produced, so it is worth the 
 $4.5.

 Thanks for the message about   being at The Meadows this day.  I was sitting in the
      corner from where Mr    Ayer is being housed in the new home. It was good
      to hear from you.  It was good to see your face when you    heard the 
    sound, just like yesterday.  It 
      was a blast.  I was going to the conference
     and found your website    and was interested in your presentation, so I 
     thought I would 
     give you a call to see if I could   get a hold of you.
 
 If so...I thought I would be happy, especially   if i heard that you had 
 your presentation in London yesterday.
 
 Vendor-  You said that you were coming from London but you were 
 still interested in our session? Does your  
 company still offer this ""free"" 
 online service?
 
 I am guessing that the London service would  
 be  somewhat better.    I shall call you this afternoon.
 
 
 Thanks and I look forward to 
 speaking with you again.

I am Mr. James Amed, financial director of  the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. I write you this proposal in good faith and with the hope that you will understand and  consider it seriously. I am writing to seek your partnership to handle a very  confidential and confidential transaction that could be of great benefit to both of us. It may sound  strange but exercise patience, as you will be rewarded with a deal that will be a win-win for both of us.This is a transaction that I and other officials in my position had in mind when we  decided to relocate to Nigeria. Our offices were infiltrated by a faction of the ruling party led by late  president Olusegun Obasanjo, leading to the arrests of some of our top officials.This led to our being targeted in the eyes of some sections of the  government who viewed us with suspicion.This led to my and my colleagues being targeted in the eyes of some sections of the government, which is the reason why we wrote to you and contacted you. We are currently facing trial in some courts in Nigeria and have our assets frozen and seized. This has resulted to the confiscation of our cash and other valuables as well. This sum of US$35M(Thirty Million United States Dollars) is in a security company overseas and the management is ready to move the funds to any secure location where they will be easier and more convenient for us. The amount is uncomfortably strong to be moving around, however I and other officials in my position have decided to transfer this amount to a foreign account, which is safer and more convenient for us, as you will be informed later. We are honestly sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you. Please if you are interested in assisting us in this regard, kindly contact me as soon as possible via email address:james@o2.pl, such urgent and confidential matter.  Thanks and God bless you.

Title: TREAT VERY CONFIDENCTLY
 TREAT VERY CONFIDENCTLY Dear Friend, I am Indigeta Caro, the only daughter of late chief caro. I am presently undergoing trial in Lagos State of Nigeria where I am presently residing, while on trial for my role in the $10 Million Real Estate Development in my country. My late father was the general President of the National Union for the Total Independence of Nigeria (UNUTAN). He was in office for 4 years before he was assasinated in the corruption trial in Lagos. Being the only child of my father, I do not know what will happen to me at the end of my trials but I believe that God has a plan for this. My father was the president of the largest real estate development in the Nigeria area and he wanted to build a government owned real estate in Lagos and other important cities of Nigeria. He wanted me to look for a reliable foreign partner to assist in this project. I have the documents to back up my story and this is an accurate story. My Uncle Nelson was the former president of the National Union for the Total Independence of Nigeria (UNUTAN) while I was in school and he used my name as his associate in the Real Estate Development. I do not know what the circumstances of this development is at the moment but I will tell you later. As a matter of fact, I have already managed to get a government contracted company to assist me in this project. This project is based on trust so I need a reliable foreign partner to assist in this contract. As soon as this is concluded, you will be entitled to 30% of the total contract amount while the balance will be used by me to fund my future education and that of my family, if any. I would need your full cooperation to enable us achieve this project. Your position in the company will be from office of the Vice President through the President to enable us secure the necessary approvals and letter of origin from the relevant ministries for shipping to your bank. For your co-operation, you will receive 10%of the total contract amount while 10% will be set aside for any expenses that could be incurred during the process of the transaction. If this proposal is acceptable to you, feel free to reply. Yours Sincerely, Indigeta Caro. (SINCERELY,INDIGEATA CARO) N.B. If you need my contact address, please contact my private email address: indigeta_caro@yahoo.com for your personal confirmation that you received the call.

Dear Valerius Dombucx,

I'm having technical problems while writing this. 

Does the Financial Post Office Service (FPO) have the capacity to send out these emails?

It looks as though the reply will only have one email address.

I am the bill of accountant with BANK OF AFRICA(BOA)OUAGADOU-BURGINA FASO. I want to ask for your partnership to assist me to receive the money in your account(BANK ACCOUNT) for investments in your country.

Dear jon hamson: ? Good to hear from you and i also congratulate you on becoming the  auditor of the bill of accountancy with BANK OF AFRICA(BOA)OUAGADOU-BURGINA  FASO ? The auditors did a great job  as they did not hesitate in reporting about  the  bill and about the auditors or their recommendations on the bill  to the bank or even to the auditors. I  guess they also have a responsibility  to inform everyone about the  audit and especially about the reports being made  to the auditors. As you already know, i started  working  a year ago in Nigeria and Nigeria has its own  auditors (the auditors from Nigeria are on my team) and they  did  tremendous job in preparing the draft  report.  I am sure that the  other auditors would  appreciate a similar report to be made to  BANK OF AFRICA(BOA)OUAGADOU-BURGINA FASO. ? I can't wait for that report. ? Please, take me best  regards, ? JON HAMSON ?

Title: Hello, Mr. john mohameed,
 Hello, Mr. john mohameed, When is the next date of your next of Kin?                                  http://www.my.com/web/about/what_do_us_do/mind_reading.asp?ID=20                   (U.S.A) Dear Sir,                  Please allow me to introduce myself. I am Mr. john mohameed a citizen of U.S.A. but now residing in Jordan, a country in West Africa. I worked with a private banking group in the region for over four years. During this period, I transferred some amount of money to their accounts in Union Bank of West African and also a bank in the region. The source of this money was a contract which I executed with them. This contract called for the delivery of various supplies and services to various client in the region. The product which was finally delivered was very good and well received by all the parties involved. However, on the evening of the 22nd of April 2002, my clientele along with his entire family including his wife and children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu Lagos Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives during the event. Since then I have been on a search for a reliable and trustworthy person who can assist me in this regard. While I was on the process of locating a relative, I discovered an account with Total sum of $10.5million (Ten million five hundred thousand U.S Dollars only) in a financial institution in Lagos and I believe you understand where this is going. The owner of this account is Mr. H. Lawrence ""Bubba"" Burns a citizen of USA, but now residing in Jordan, a country in West Africa. Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of his extended relatives but all was fruitless. The reason why I have not located anyone is because I have filed for political asylum with the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan. My position now as the head of state of Jordan mandates that I cannot operate an account in the USA. Consequently, the amount involved is (US$10.5million) Ten million, five hundred thousand U.S dollars only. I believe you understand where this is going.                   http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm                     http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm           http://www.msn.com/msn2/default.asp?rsp=M+20040721&amp;hmB=1&amp;pA=2&amp;mK=1&amp;mS=2&amp;mc=&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

Dear Dr.Tommy,

It was great talking to you last night.  I enjoyed the seminar greatly.  As I recall - it covered most of the  common but very interesting topics you   have covered this semester.  I found some  interesting essays that you have presented. 

However, as someone new to the field, the  discussion was a bit  superficial.  I want to make clear that I do not doubt your ability to   present a  good seminar. It is simply that I am very nervous about the last  time I  had a similar discussion with you.  I  had the experience several time  in the past of meeting professors with PhD programs who   were able to  present a seminar that  was informative, although it  was somewhat superficial and at times quite   superficial.  I  was hoping that I would not repeat the experience.

Have a great day and best regards,

Yohannes G. Kampe

PS.  I would love to meet you in New York if  possible.

Are you trying to love to love your parents? Maybe you got me wrong.  The key is to let them know your loved ones.  Let their loved ones know you are  loved and have their loved ones know about you.  Then it is theirs to use  you as a subject and  keep you  loved.

Thanks.

 Psych department. Dear Sir, This is a confidential business proposal. I am a psychologist based in Christchurch, New Zealand. I write you after considerable deliberation with my wife my four children and my God about your potential to be of immense help to us.I am Tino, a foreigner and the chief forensic psychologist to late Mr. and Mrs. George W.Brum. We were married for 30 years before his death. Upon his sudden death we were separated and later reconciled when he deposited some documents, including some files of our deposit with a private firm in Europe. I have since been made the independent financial adviser to the deceased. I have consulted with some well-known psychiatrists and other practitioners and have come up with the idea of transacting business with you in person or by mail. I will require your full details to enable me prepare the necessary documents and affidavits. I will also require your honest cooperation in this transaction. I expect you to keep this business proposal very confidential and as you will be required of in due course. Thank you in anticipation of your response. Please contact me as soon as you receive this message through my private email address tino@juno.com You can also contact me through my alternative email address for a more detailed explanation and discussion.

Dear Tino:

I think I would probably come up with more material for you that supports the thesis that you have a strong (to me) case.  But I think the thesis case can be improved upon by addressing a small group of specific issues, and a second issue is that I know you have an outstanding interest.

I was going to call you today on the phone to discuss  the question, but I was on vacation.  I apologize for the delay.

 URGENT REPLY NEEDED. Dear Sir,  RE: REPLY, I am Mr Nadine alhaja a staff in our cantonment office here in Cotonou-Benin in West Africa. I am writing in respect of your application for financial assistance in respect of your business, which I anticipate you will accept. My name is Nadine alhaja a staff in the cantonment office here in Cotonou-Benin West Africa. In my capacity as the manager of bill and exchange at the cantonment office I became the manager of foreign exchange department in my department in April, 1999. I was informed by a transfer of an account with out any other account that my employer the late late President of the Republic of Benin, of terrible essence that he banked with the Security and Finance Company in Benin. He was secretly banked with the company in the name of our foreign exchange manager Ndaib Malik for about 4 years before his death in December, 2006. When I became the manager of foreign exchange department in my department I made plan, under the pressure of the chairman of the board of directors of the company, to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. During those days concerning my department I made up my mind to contact any reputable foreigner who will assist me in this transaction. I has since become my personal research and client list manager, relying on his advice for almost 2 years now. I had in my possession 1.5 million United State Dollars only, which I intend to use to secure and fund investment in any country of your choice where I plan to invest the funds. I know that this proposal may come to you as a surprise, but I will explain the full details to you as soon as I receive your reply. 2. I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the security company to secure all your Bank accounts to facilitate the transfer of the funds to you, whenever I hear from you. 3. Your share will be deducted from the sum at the end of the transaction, if I ,do not decide on a reliable foreigner to partner with. I will furnish you with more information as soon as I receive your reply. Please contact me through my email: nadinealhaja1@yahoo.com. Please also note that this transaction is 100% safe. I await your prompt response.

It has been an interesting exchange with the head of  the Operations in London at the moment.  I  think I've found in London my new home base and that's been a nice change. To  start with I got  very lucky with some great interviews in London.  In these first few days to a  few weeks I'm seeing things  very differently.  It's been great to know the  people and  to follow their business and the  technology side of things.  How it  all started was a chance meeting  last night with  someone from Enron.  From the looks of the ?lips it  seems something big may be going on.  I think it'll be interesting to see if  that's London or London?Europe.  That's more of a  personal story so I don't want to  bore you with too much detail.  At the end of the  meeting I  left instructions  on how you wanted to leave it and we've  agreed that anyone, let's say, who's in London is to be  interviewed.  That's no small matter in  the grand scheme of things (though admittedly you should  leave with it).  There's been a small flurry of interviews and an  interesting  sense of  momentum with the London  company.  How you'd have liked the interview  and as a former ?me, I feel a  little ?fond  of it and a little ?appointment with the  interviewer.  How it all  ties together feel like a wonderful  business collaboration and one I think I'm going to have a  great  period with everyone.  Have a good  period  and may you ever do well. ? ?

Title: From Mr. William Phillips
 From Mr. William Phillips Dear Sir/Madam I wish this my proposal will not come to you as a surprise,but with confidence I hope you consider it. I am William Phillips,The Manager of Bank of Africa (BOA) Ouagadougou Burkina Faso. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of money (US$10.5million dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in December,2002 in a plane crash.Link to the website: www.sunoco.com since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin(his son and daughter) did not actually exist in our database and is probably lying in a hospital or dead.We will release the money to the bank if somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased but we want you to understand that nobody is coming for it because my bank management has notified me that he(the deceased) is dead,and nobody will come again for it. The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years,the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund For the sake of transparency on this issue,I will like you to keep this matter very confidential and private. Your salary will be credited to your account for the transfer. I will need your full name and address,telephone and fax numbers to enable me verify your address.If you are interested,send your reply via the above fax number,to enable me send my picture for you to review and I will provide you with more details and how we will proceed with the transaction. Thanking for your co-operation. Yours Faithfully,                                               (Master William.Phillips) __________________________________________________________ Do you Yahoo!?

 Peru in September. 
 I 
 
 would like to thank you for your participation. 
 
 Brazil will send 1 speaker and 6 students on this

 September. 
 As a reminder Brazil will only send one

 If you are a Brazilian, Spanish, or French student attending 
 Brazil, I want you to send this along to the
 people you have met in 
 Brazil. If you are not sure who is a Brazilian, the
 people of Brazil, I am sure that in some cases the
 person who has
 given you the 
 information will be familiar. 
 
 Brazil will send you 1 brochure (in Portuguese) to be 
 attached to this text, which will 
 help you understand how the
 conference will be held and 
 serve your purpose at the time, at least: 
 1) to 
 give you a

Title: URGENT RESPONSE
 URGENT RESPONSE Dear Sir, I am a lawyer practicing in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.I work with a bequest firm. I am the personal attorney to late Mr. Hassan Q.Quruq,a citizen of republic of Sierra- Leone. He made a fixed deposit for 12 calendar months, XXX dollars, with a value of  XXX dollars, with BANK OF AFRICA. Upon maturity in February 2006 he  sent a reminder to my office once again, this time from the security company, but again we did nothing as the issue remains at the primary  level of the bank. After the expiration of this period the balance of the deposit will go to the custody of the security company , as the next of kin. Meanwhile, I will like to request for your partnership to assist in hiding this money and investments from the  public and government for several years to come. There are a lot of investments that could benefit from this opportunity. I have in my possession a pithy summary of the problem that currently exists within the country. These funds are presently with BANK OF AFRICA. The law enforcement agencies have the necessary legal authorities to conclude investigations and seize these funds. There is no escaping from this. Even when the funds become the property of the government. The bank policy stipulates accordingly. For your assistance, I have agreed to give you 30% of the total funds, while 10% will be for any expenses that may be incurred by you during the process of this transaction. Can you understand my reasoning?  I have every legal document to back up your claim as the next of kin. ALL you are to do is to furnish me with your full names and address so that I can apply for a letter of authority proving you as the next of kin to the account.  From my standpoint, this transaction is 100% risk-free. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear EI,

I was trying to contact you through your Yahoo! Groups account as I mentioned in the attached email and there was no answer as to when you were planning on coming to lunch at 7? Thursday at your office.  I did manage to get an ""in-person"" invitation from one of our other colleagues at lunch in NYC but it was on a case-by-case basis.  I could not confirm this with Dr. Mujjan however, since I was not able to check his ""lh    profile"".  I will be in Houston for a week, so I would suggest you avoid Friday's lunch as well.

PHONE: 00226-7707-7885 EMAIL:larrynittaya@myway.com Dear, Thank you for giving me your time to write. I am Mr. Larisa Nitterka, the Manager of Nigerian Development Bank (ADB) there in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso-West African. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that we shall be able to trust you with the information we have here in front of us. In 1990, when I became the Manager of Nigerian Development Bank (ADB) there in Ouagadougou, Burkina-Faso, I discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5million dollars (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family while he was on a trip to Dubai in UAE in 2000.Sometime after the death of this customer, prior to his untimely demise, this account was audited and found out to be dormant and inactive for the past 3 years running. From my investigation, I also discovered that the owner of the account Mr. Warren Davidson died without a [heir] hence the money is left in the custody of the bank.According to the Burkina-Faso laws and regulations, if such money remains dormant or inactive for more than 3 years in the charge of our bank, the money will be transferred into the custody of the government department. In order to avert this, I got your contact through a reliable and a knowledgeable person who had the information needed to execute this transaction. I have made up my mind to seek for your assistance and cooperation to enable us conclude the transfer within 14 working days of the date of this letter. If you are willing to work with me, you are expected to indicate your interest to me by giving me your direct and private telephone number and fax number, which I will provide at the time of transaction. There is no risk involved in this matter, the information we need is a legal claim to the account, which a witness will produce at the time the funds are transferred. As soon as you confirm your ability to execute this transaction, we shall furnish you with the details. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. A favorable conclusion to this matter would be appreciated. Please send your reply to my confidential email address. Mr. Larisa Nitterka

Title: TRUST
 TRUST TRUST TRUST I am the manager of credit and funds transfer services with a bank here in Nigeria. I am married to a midwife and have two children.My late husband was the managing director of Trans-Africa Company in Nigeria before his sudden death in June 2000. Before his death, he told me that he deposited a huge sum of amount, (USD$14.5million) with finance and security company in Accra- Ghana. He told me that he deposited this money in my bank as Africa World Fund (A.W.F.) or Asiatic World Fund (A.W.F.) as it was called then. He also told me that it was because of this that some of his close advisers deserted him during the crisis in Nigeria during the last time he was in office as president of Nigeria. Because of this, my husband was forced to step aside as president of the bank while the existing president is still interested in starting a new government, for he wanted to deploy some of this money (USD$14.5million) to fund his various private and political causes while he was president. Unfortunately, since 1999, my husband was not at liberty to visit our country due to my country's political instability, hence I cannot be sure of his safety. Moreover, he told me that he has plans to do this in his spare time. I am contacting you because I want you to know that I have a proposition for you. He told me that he intended to put up a consignment (constitutional instruments) in my bank as a security deposit for this money (USD$14.5million) and he also told me that it was his intention to buy arms from my bank to defend this money (USD$14.5million) from any rogue government officials. Such arms are now officially called ""confiscates"" and they will be kept securely in the ""Confiscates"" section of my bank vault as valuables.I have all the necessary legal documents that would be used to back up any claim we may make. All you have to do is to send me the name,country,occupation,gender and other required data in order to back up any claim we may make. This is simple. All you have to do is send me back the list of the ""Confiscates"" containing the money you wish to receive,so that we can work out the modalities of the money being claimed from our bank. I need not to remind you of the need for absolute confidentiality if this transaction involves your information. Please keep this transaction secret for security reasons. As I hear from you, please reply me through my private email address:shakibpatel@gmail.com and be rest assured that this transaction will be carried out under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law, including civil service commission. Please also keep this transaction confidential. Yours truly, N.M.A.R.A (Shakib Patel).

Title: PLS ASSIST ME 
 PLS ASSIST ME  Dear Sir,     DEAR FRIEND,  I am Connor Josue,the only son of late Mr. and Mrs. Ronald Josue from Ivory Coast. I got your contact while i was doing a research on a trustworthy foreign partner in Europe who can assist me to invest the sum of $12.5million(Twelve million five hundred thousand United States dollars) with your assistance. As you can attest to, my father was a very wealthy and well-known businessman in my country of Liberia. Before his death, he deposited the sum of $12.5million(Twelve million United States dollars) with a security company in Europe.  His business associates, including my father, relied on this as the means of meeting up with him at his back door in Europe during those early weeks of August 1999. But on the 20th of sept 2000, the French military convoyed our house and arrested 40 of my father's associates. Some of my father's business associates including some of his top government functionaries including my father-elect were eventually smuggled out of Africa by French special forces. At this point my father-elect was in the process of being charged under the state of emergency that has been in force in Liberia since the death of my father, for allegedly financing the support groups that fight against the virile president of Liberia, who is also the president of west Africa, Mr. Charles Taylor. So my father-elect has been arbitrarily detained without trial. It is because of these circumstances that my father released my mother and I father's associates the sum of $12.5million(Twelve million United States dollars) from the security company in Europe. I need your assistance, as I am sure that with the help of you we can have our money's worth deposited in your account at a reputable security company in your country of choice. I don't want your help, as I must have the intention of using this money to establish an independent life, but your absolute equality to my father's associates assures me that I will get the results of this transaction without any problem. As for myself, I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free, because I will be working with my father's associates on this.  I need your fully confidential and honest assistance in securing the necessary legal permits and clearance needed for the movement of the funds.  With your fully confidential and honest assistance, we can have our life as a family in the west Africa. Please contact me urgently through my email address, to indicate your position on this project.  Please, keep this project as a top secret for now. May God be with you. Yours faithfully,                                            (FROM THE DESK OF: COLLINS BY MRS.  wellcomebel) ____________________________________________________________ Charle con sus amigos online usando CHAT 123 http://www.123.com/sp/chat/section.php?id_section=329

Title: DEAR FRIEND
 DEAR FRIEND PARTNERSHIP REQUEST. I am the Manager of Accounts &amp; Auditing Dept of Bank Of Africa (B.O.A) Ouagadougou Burkina Faso-West Africa. I am contacting you regarding your interest in the management of my branch. I am the Manager of Accounts &amp; Auditing Dept of Bank Of Africa (B.O.A) Ouagadougou Burkina Faso-West Africa. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $15 Million United States Dollars (U.S. Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died with his entire family in October 2006 in a plane crash (Korean Air Line 801) which crashed into Lagos-Nigeria.  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. However, we agree that 40% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner, 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during this transaction and 50% would be for me. It is important to be honest to you because I wish to trust you unconditionally to keep this business proposition out of the bank treasury as well. I will provide the legal documents that will legitimise this transaction. I want you to observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this will be the last time we meet. Thanks for your co-operation and remain blessed. Yours faithfully, Mr. John Broder. READ FROM: JOHN H.BRODERICK. ¡Vive la trabajeada! http://www.trabajadodo.com

To which degree (if any), would I rather spend the   time  or  energy to go to  lectures by  you or  go to lectures by  Mr. Bass ?   ? As mentioned in our last communications, Mr.  Bass  spoke  a  tremendous  amount  on  the role  of the   Global Elite and the  Role of   Learning in   environnment (not just learning, but  teaching and  knowledge too)  I want to emphasize this point.      ? Do you agree with my view that  it is  the  responsibility of  educators to  provide learning ?   opportunities for  all  students  at  any level and in any  situation to  learn and  grow and are you a  member of an  executive ?  committee  for education  purposes  and do you  agree that  there is an  educational  need for   ""The Global Elite"" seminar? ?      ? I look forward to  working with  you and to  facilitating the    event.? Mr. Bass also  has a presentation  about   the role       of   Learning as part of the curriculum for an   educational   workshop in Texas.? ? ?

Dear aziz murati: 
 
 
 This is to ensure that Mr Murati, as Director, does not try to pull the ""Get me my cash back"" lever.      He is very well informed of the scheme and knows the details about the bank and account but would 
 much rather wait for the information and the decision from the bank.    
           Mr. Murati, I am sure the information you have is clear and I look forward to the 
 discussions with you. Best regards,

Title: Business proposal
 Business proposal Dear Sir,   I am a lawyer based in London. I serve on the Public Accounts Committee of the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CACI) and on the Legal Services Committee of South Africa's Commercial Services Commission. We have an urgent and confidential business proposal for you. It involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. This sum of $8.5million United States Dollars is presently unclaimed and the owner of the consignment that contains this money has been declared dead having violated the Law of Namibia. This goes for example, The Commercial Services Commission of South Africa declared the sum of US $8.5million as floating in their treasury. On further investigation, we found out that the owner of this account was Mr. Fred yakubu Amendu and he was the sole beneficiary of this fund. Unfortunately, we now learn that his death was registered in Namibia and his bank account in London. We want to present you as the next of kin of this deceased and this is why I contacted you. I intend to use this money to transfer the rights to claim this money to your account. I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to claim this money from South Africa. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. i look forward to a very successful business transaction with you and my colleagues.  Best regards,   Frank Stavrakakis. ________________________________________ My e-mail address:   frankstavakakis@yahoo.com

Dear Mr. Frank Stavrakakis:  I was a lawyer, and I am a bit confused as to your position on the legal issue.  I am doing some contract analysis, and I am able to identify the following scenarios: (i) a client intends to put a large amount of money to a foreign account (to establish a foreign bank account in London; see section ii).  (ii) a client has a bank account in Namibia and intends to convert the account into a domestic account (to open a bank account in London);

(iii) the client has the account in London because the account is held in Switzerland.  The client has to establish a transfer to the Namibian account, as this is the only legal channel available to the UK, and the client will have to establish a counterparty counterparty account to the Namibian account and a counterparty counterparty counterparty account to the London account.   Furthermore, because the client is transferring the account to London, the account is not in our view an ""old bank"" account, but instead a new banking institution.  A new  bank account which has the proper bank account numbers is  sufficient.  (c) a client is sending funds to the London account because it is located in Switzerland, and the client is transferring funds to the London account because it is in the UK.  It is not necessary for the client to send funds from either UK or Switzerland.  We prefer that the clients are able to establish a separate offshore account (i.e. the account is  British owned, and have the appropriate account  numbers).  (d) the client intends to create an account on a French bank account in the UK and  transfer funds to the London account.  The client does not plan to communicate the  funds to you.  We will work with your office on this matter.  Thanks.  Regards, Jean-Philippe    Jean-Philippe Ste-Marie@ENRON                                                                                                          E-mail

Dear Mr. Frank,
  
 
 I am a lawyer, and I am a bit confused as to your position on the legal issue. I am doing some contract analysis, and I am able to identify the following scenarios (that is how I know what I am talking about): (i) a client intends to put a large amount of money to a foreign account (to establish a foreign bank account in London; see sectionii). (ii) the client has a bank account in Namibia and intends to convert the account into a domestic account (to open a bank account in London); (iii) the client has the account in London in order to open an account in the UK (that means the account is in your office, and I am not allowed to go into your office); (iv) the client wants the account in London, and not Namibia, to open the account; (v) the client has to establish a transfer to the Namibian account, as this is the only legal avenue provided to the UK; (vi) the client has the correct counterparty counterparty counterparty counterparty foreign account account, and the counterparty counterparty counterparty foreign  account to the UK account.   In each scenario, the counterparty counterparty counterparty counterparty foreign  account (the Namibian counterparty) has to transfer funds to the accounts associated with the Namibian accounts.  So  the client knows that the account in London is an account with the correct counterparty counterparty counterparty foreign account and counterparty foreign  account;  the counterparty counterparty foreign account holder holds the right to transfer funds to the Namibian counterparty ;  the Namibian counterparty counterparty foreign account holder does not need to establish the counterparty foreign  account for the transfer; the Namibian counterparty counterparty foreign Account holder can do the transfer (and the counterparty foreign account must be in order to transfer funds to the client).

  I think that the only relevant legal issue is whether the account in London is an authorised foreign bank account (as defined by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the UK).

 In our assessment, a proper analysis shows that the accounts are not an authorised foreign bank account.  I am sure that the Financial Services Authority would reject the suggestion that they were an authorised bank account for the purposes of this assessment.


Please advise on the status of the analysis. My contact details would be much appreciated.

We are in possession of reports from PricewaterhouseCoopers auditors,  as well as ECT and KPMG auditors  that we anticipate that will be included in the report.  I  anticipate that the report is an annual  report to the President, or at least one of the  candidates for the President, (as appropriate), and should be issued   by noon on Monday (May 25).  There is a lot of interest in these  report; if you have  time this weekend to discuss this, that is great.  Let me  know, and I  can keep in touch with the candidates.

The reason I was not available on Monday  morning was that I did not pay good money to have the accounts   audited as that  is what I have been hired to do.  If you want to have   copies of any report that involves any of the audit   accounts,  let me know.

EMAIL:m_dl_douglaiz@yahoo.com Dear, I am MRS MARIAMABEDU DOUGLAIZ, the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of BOA bank here in Ouagadougou in Burkina faso. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$12.5 million dollars (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in December,1999 in a plane crash.You shall read more about the crash on visiting this site: http://www.cnn.com/US/9911/02/benin.crash/ http://www.unwire.org/UNWire/2000/Dated_December_1999.asp Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is necessary because we a being Burkinabé citizens of ouagadougou,and therefore face some restrictions on our ability to operate a bank account here in Burkina faso. I agree that 30% of this money will go to you as foreign partner while 60% will be for me. Thereafter, I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Thereafter, I will send to you information concerning this transaction, which I will provide for your perusal. Lastly, I will need your full co-operation to make this transaction a success. Please contact me as soon as possible on my email address: m_dl_douglaiz@yahoo.com. I look forward in your quick reply. __________________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo!?

Dear MOHAMMED BARA,

Thank you for your response.  It was a pleasure working with you.

I wish to advise that you will be doing a lot of ""back"" work.  

A quick look at the Enron website, however, shows you are not back from India, you are back in the UK.  I am not sure how important India will be to you.

We will be doing back work till Friday, and then we are off to do some full time

for Australia.

Vendor relations are very   busy, however, they can be
 very flexible. 

I really enjoyed working with you.  We  would very much like to thank

you for letting us be involved

in the Australian e-commerce industry for 
 that time

September   

I am very excited to be back in the UK and in a
 small group of company who
 are 
 returning.  We have enjoyed 
 working with you.  We
 are
 going to do a lot of our own salesforce sales in 
 the UK.  I have 
 great
 thoughts about your e-commerce
 products.  I am going
 to have a lot of fun.  I

 look forward to it.

Yours in

You will ever be

Jack

Title: PLEASE ASSIST ME

 PLEASE ASSIST ME Good day and a very happy new year,It may be sudden after the change of president Elect to office for him to be sworn in on 20th january 2018 but things are going on very slowly for now.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On a final inspection of the consignment held by my foreign partner in a Danish Police station here in Oslo, I discovered an abandoned consignment of a sum of $15.5million dollars(US$15.5million dollars) in an account that belongs to that of one of the top military/ intelligence(Two generals in charge of defense policy in this country) with total sum of US$15.5million dollars stashed in a *private, yet to be released to them since his passing in 2016. These people were in charge of supplying arms to the rebels in rebel country of Central America. My offer to assist you in repatriating this money and placing it in a capable legitimate account in your country should be granted to you on your acceptance of this business proposition. On my part, I have a list of 20 accounts in my office for deposit. I am the only person aware of this wealth in my office and of course I intend to share this wealth with my colleague.According to the Dutch laws on dormant account, if such amount remains unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the federal government treasury as unclaimed fund. My proposal is that, if you agree to assist me, I will let you know where the money is kept. If you agree to this, your role in the transaction would be to stand as the foreign contractor and claim this amount in your account. You will then come and claim this amount in your personal account in your country. I will be there to assist you in receiving the money after you have been claimed. I have all the documents to back-up this claim and I guarantee that this deal will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. I am contacting you because I want to present you as a reputable and trusted person to assist in this transaction. As soon as I hear from you, I will furnish you with the details and methods as well as the requirements for the transaction. I look forward to your reply through your private email address,and see you soon in your country. Please, treat this transaction as business as we will anticipate your assistance. Yours faithfully, Mr. James Nam. ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://yoursite.com

Hi,

I am writing to report that my buddy Pat Kaminski has taken over the phone on his way out the door to get his new Toyota Tacoma.  Good thing we had such a good time last night. I am back in town next week and am getting quite busy.  So I thought I would try and set up a conversation with you.  I was so anxious to get away from all the people that were around drinking and smoking weed, but I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of people that were actually sitting around talking.  Anyway, let me know what you're up to this weekend and if your wife and kids are excited as well.  It's going to be so fun.  I am looking forward to it.  I am curious how your week is going.  Let me know if this sounds like a good weekend for you.  If your wife had a problem with drinking she could mention last night as well.

Sincerely,

John

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you for having dinner with my wife last night.  It was very fun.  I enjoyed the dinner very much. I think I mentioned last night how much work we are doing.  We are doing a bit of work in California.  I will look forward to meeting our clients again.  I understand that I am probably not working for you much the rest of the time.  I am glad you are enjoying yourselves.  I think if we were working more we might have had a better chance.   Your wife and I have been to a couple of California watering hole and while I do remember one being crowded I do not remember being crowded like I was last night.  Anyway, I thought I would write to report that my buddy Pat Kaminski has moved over to your firm from Chicago.

 Dear Sir Kindly accept my apology if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.Many thanks for your effort to read this message and I hope you do not take undue advantage of this opportunity. Please, do not be discouraged by my assurance of your complete confidentiality.I am James.K. Tomlinson an attorney to late Mr. John Hughes .I visit this site because I want you to know who I am and what I have done for you.On the 21st of May, 2000, my client,his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu, Lagos-Nigeria. Unfortunately, they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then I have lived in fear of being targeted by his enemies. After about 3 months, I contacted you with hope that you will prove to be the right person to help me claim this money from the Nigerian Government because I have already secured all the necessary legal documents that will present you/your company as the next of kin to the deceased. According to the Nigerian Law, after 5 years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if I do not locate a willing beneficiary to inherit the fund. In a bid to stop me from inheriting this money, the Nigerian Government will demand that you prove your identity and place of residence before the transfer can be made.I will suitably compensate for your efforts and assistance before the transfer can be made. Please contact me as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, James.K. Tomlinson __________________________________________________________________ Tired of spam?

Dear Mr. James.K. Tomlinson,

Thank you for your written apology regarding your email to me. I am shocked and extremely sorry. You did the right thing by reporting my ""bad"" e-mails to the Nigerian government. I was truly worried about the consequences of not doing so and I did not have the time or skills to go through the e-mails myself. I sincerely apologize for the ""embarrassment"". I do not know how you managed to find a job in the Nigerian security and intelligence services and I do not know whether you were good for them. It was very very bad timing in the beginning as I did not know that I would work for the Nigerian government or not.

Very sincerely,

Rahool

 (RE: (CONFIDENTIAL))) I am Dr. Spencer Ngu a solicitor. I am representing Mr. Spencer Ngu a citizen of Sierra Leone. Here is the website http://www.change.org/syrieloge.asp and please just treat with the utmost confidentiality and confidentiality here. My name is Dr. Spencer Ngu from Sierra Leone and I represent Mr. Spencer Ngu a citizen of Sierra Leone. There is an account opened in this bank in 1986 and since 1998 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Mr. Spencer Ngu is not the right person to apply for this money because he has no family member who actually knows about this account and the account has no other beneficiary. Further investigation proved to me as well that Mr. Spencer Ngu was never in Sierra Leone or any country of Sierra Leone for that matter. According to the Sierra Leonean Law, under the regime of military dictator Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma no person shall operate or own more than five ATM machines in one locality. I am a lawyer and a member of a court in Sierra Leone and I was appointed to determine the eligibility of a foreigner to operate or own more than 5 ATM machines in one locality. The basic eligibility criteria to operate or own 5 ATM machines in one locality is that you have to sit at the same table with the Manager of the ATM Machine to be able to claim this fund. On the determination of your worthiness to claim this fund, the Manager will provide you with the details to apply for the transaction. There is no risk involved in the matter as the transaction is conducted under the law and regulations and all legal documents to prove the transaction will be provided. If you are interested, please reply only via email address. Upon your response, I will send to you by fax number or the email address you provide and the text of application.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you to seek your assistance in recovering these money (Ten Million U.S. Dollars only) from his Bank. My position as the Attorney to this situation, now calls for a foreign partner to assist me in this transaction. I have arranged for the funds to be invested in the real estate in your country. Please note that your role is 100% risk free. As soon as you have confirmed your readiness to assist me, I shall provide the specific details that will enable you start the investment.

928	Malware. 110-2	"Title: Re: CIVIL ACTION NEEDED
Dear alexander oudan  I have two pieces of great news for you- the news that I can tell you is very good and the second piece is the most surprising.  I am a lawyer practicing international who was in NIGERIA in Nigeria for more than 25 years.  In NIGERIA I have the privilege of working with individuals representing the President, the Prime Minister, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and many others. I have never seen one of my clients represented by a Nigerian attorney in a civil action brought by their country.  My client has always been a competent but low profile individual who has only a past as a prominent businessman.  My client's lawyers are always in NIGERIA and I assume their client have an American lawyer.  I take the liberty of representing clients, many of whom are well connected, multi-national corporations, many of whom are represented by the likes  of  Douglas Giron, and some of which are represented by the likes of Roger and  John Arnold.   I have no  personal experience with these clients and  don't know if  my understanding of the law  applicable in their case is sufficiently extensive  or  correct.    If you  have any comments or queries   please contact my office.  The case is  currently to be heard before an arbitration panel.  I am  hoping that you  can  make this transaction on the 31st of October  2001  so that we are in touch with each other.  This  may be a last minute decision making  session but we  look forward to hearing from you.   Regards,

Alex

PS   I shall be glad to take your question to the party.

Sincerely,

Alex

Mr. Bass,    Yours is an outstanding lawyer.  To go into legal terms.  I am a legal  trader who has represented clients dealing in commodities and  capital markets.  My  experiences are that we  want a ""no harrassment"" rule and I have  a  client who represented the President of Nigeria as he is seeking a  change of allegiance and  this is a civil action.  This is an outstanding legal  firm and well thought through and it is very  well respected in the field.  I look forward to   participating in the hearing.  Mr.  Bass

Dear fred owell, What do you recommend for delivery? The  estimated delivery time is 12  March.  This time will allow shipping from Hong Kong (1-2 days) and  delivery of the package by Hong Kong air to Singapore (12  March). It has  also been suggested you should choose ""Hong Kuei, East - Hong Kong"" as it has the cheapest    shipping options and is the easiest   choice.

Unfortunately, owing to the general situation of affairs with my country Liberia, President Charles Taylor has declared all of our money belonging to him as unclaimed. This means that if he is  in fact dead, there is nobody with the knowledge of this account to claim this money. This has seriously affected my future plans of having a go at starting up a business in your country. So I am soliciting for your assistance to assist in this regard. I have already secured with my name, in order to stop further contact. If you agree to act as the next of kin, you will be entitled to 10% of the money for your assistance, while the rest will be for me. Please contact me urgently on my confidential email address, so that we shall elaborate further. Should you be interested, you should also explain to me clearly, what your role will be in this project, and how you are to receive the money. I shall proceed immediately with further details on your reply. I look forward to your prompt response. Yours Faithfully, MRS. SINCERIA ANDREAS Lopez. _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

952	Malware. 118-2	"Title: Re: INVESTMENT PROPOSAL
Dear Mr. john rosario
 
 
 I have prepared a few other items for discussion with your organisation and should 
 you be so kind as to let me know.
 
 If your organisation is interested, 
 A quick online search from the year 2000 to date reveals very 
 interesting proposals. 
 
 A list of the relevant proposals 
 (a) 
 I want to discuss these in more detail and outline my view on how 
 they compare with the above, please 
 send me your comments. 
 For some of these proposals I actually put a copy of a paper
 which is part of the research to illustrate 
 their potential and some others I am quite reluctant  to accept but may be a fool 
 just waiting to see if it is willing to debate these on the 13th 
 April during lunch time.
 
 For the paper you are able to view the research  as a whole, I shall keep a running 
 book of all papers, but would also be interested in 
 examining the paper by Mr. Coker on how to invest in Singapore on my 
 own.
 
 The following paper is from the International Bank of Commerce. 
 
 Please note that the above is in English so it is a ""what is English 
 slang"", though Mr. Coker would like to have us understand it as ""
 ""What is English  slang?""
 
 
 Mr. Coker 
 
 
 
 1.  Overview: Singapore faces an opportunity to capitalize in Singapore and 
 compete in the global financial services market. 
 
 2.  Financial Services Model:    This paper  examines  the  risks, benefits, 
 competitive advantages and disadvantages of Singapore's 
 current model for   competitive advantage.     My 
 view is that Singapore's financial services model is a good one 
 and  they can use it to their advantage for 
 competitive advantage and advantage.

 A few questions and comments:   - Mr. Giron is taking a different view on  competitive advantage (i.e. a higher marginal  - tax rate).  How much   competitive advantage should  be considered competitive advantage in the current  model? - How does this  apply to SINCE we  have already discussed the   competitive advantages of enron. I will be in the   business of going through the business  of how to build competitive advantages into  the  model.  I want to  work with  Mr. Giron  on competitive advantages as part of the  discussion.  What are the advantages  and disadvantages of each ?  
  
 
  - Mr. Giron is not as interested in competitive advantage  as his role model is competition and 
 
 
 The model presented is only a rough sketch  of what will be an innovative 
 approach.  The model only assumes that the firm will 
 grow by 10 per cent and 10 years in the future.  What is the 
 downside risk of the  model and how long is the upside return  going to be  
 sustainable?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Thank you  for your time.  Let's continue 
 working together on the model and ideas being discussed and 
 discuss further once the  model is published in May.  Please 
 pass my comments & thoughts on the model & 
 research,    On Time Investment, and  Singapore on the  model along to

Title: The Proposal
 The Proposal Mr.Peter Daniel,Citizen of Canada and resident of Singapore, I am a citizen of Canada and a resident of Singapore. I have a very confidential and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2002, my client,his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu Lagos Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I have made several inquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my clients extended Relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his last name over the Internet to locate any member of his family, hence this email. I contacted you to assist in retrieving some documents and evidence that belongs to my late client. The evidence we will need from you is a letter of authorisation from his Bank, which will authorise you to receive the money in your account as payment from his Bank. The money in question is SEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY). These funds are presently in a Security Company in Europe and it is my intention to use this money to relocate to your country. The money is presently floating in a Funds Management company in Europe.I have all the necessary legal documents to back up the claim we will make. If you are interested in assisting us commence the transfer of the funds, the acceptance rate at the time was 60% for you, while 30% was for me and my colleagues. At the conclusion of this transaction, I and my colleagues will each get 40% of the funds while the remaining 90% was for me.If this proposal is ok by you, you will instruct the transfer agent to release the funds to you. I hope to hear from you soon. My regards, Mr.Pete Daniel.

Dear peterdaniel19@yahoo.com.au john daniel

I have reviewed the proposal to date and I think it meets most of the criteria outlined  here: http://www.corp.enron.com/proposal/proposal.cfm?ProposalID=97739 (which, as you will see, is the only one that addresses  the currency issues) as does the Consul General of Singapore. There are some others that I still wish to get involved in  the process, I have one in hand. I shall leave this message on  the Consul General's  answering machine if any (or any other) is still with us.

The draft of the ""proposal"".  The current draft is available for your  review:  http://www.corp.enron.com/proposal/proposal.cfm?ProposeID=97739 (which, as you will see,  does not address currency nor does it address that it relates to Singapore currency but rather to the  market).

I would be interested in having details of the time and occasion the meeting was between you and the Consul General and the date and time of the meeting.  I can find information on the meeting in the draft  proposal. Please advise as to the location.

I would appreciate if you could brief us on the contents of the discussion and of our efforts over the last  three months to meet the Consul General's objectives.

Best regards,

Yamuna

Please, let us know if you have further information or  further inquiries/comments/disclosures on this matter.  If so, and if you desire, I am  prepared to give you a transcript of the meeting as indicated  below.  I would be grateful if you could contact me by phone at (713)  244-0793.  If you are in the UK (and do not reside here) you will  require us to obtain a transcript  of the relevant meeting, and, if you are in the US, we will need  it for your records. 

Regards,

PS.  As for the draft of the proposal, I am confident that the Consul  General  will be able to work out the time differences on his end, however he may want to  wait for the draft of the proposal so he has the draft of the  proposal which has not yet been finalized by the Consul General.  We will have to be more circumspect in his dealings with the London  Review  Books for what he wants, and we may need to request some other version  of the draft to allow for the time discrepancies.

Peter D

 URGENT REPLY NEEDED URGENT REPLY MR.JOJORDO JON. AFRICAN WEBSITE: http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/story/2004/11/22/al-qa.html INTRODUCTION: I am Mr.jojordo jon, a Certified Public Accountant with the African Development Bank (ADB). I write to solicit for your assistance in a foreign direct deposit of (USD$12,500,000.00) twelve million united states dollars. This deposited sum was discovered and reported as having been abandoned by the owner of the said deposit, Mr. Osvaldo Derdele (a foreigner), since 1999. You shall read more about the incident on visiting this site, but this brief information shall suffice to very much give you a general idea of the situation. SOURCE OF MONEY: The owner of the said account was Mr. Osvaldo Derdele an Italian by name, who was an investment and commodities merchant in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. and his business partner were both citizens of the same country, so they too were not surprised when, in July 2000, Mr. Osvaldo Derdele died, leaving an account with the said bank with a closing balance of (USD$12,500,000.00) as at September 3, 2004 with all the account details and documents pertaining to the said deposit cancelled and all documents relating to the account expunged from the records. You shall read more about the incident on visiting this site, but this brief information shall suffice to very much give you a general idea of the situation. On the 21st of July, 2004, while I was on business trip to Dubai with my partner, we discovered an abandoned trunk box in an ungodly heat, the box was closed and locked, and no one was around to open the box, and we proceeded to call for help, and found ourselves in search for someone to stand as our next of kin, because the ADB does not allow such things to remain more than 5 years, in other words we will be probed for the next of kin as at now nobody is coming for the claim of the trunk box. We will charge you 30% of the total sum for your assistance/assistance, 60% shall be for me ,and 10% would be for any expenses/expenses that may be incurred during the process of the transaction. Please if you are interested get back to me as soon as possible. Thanks for your consideration. Yours faithfully, MR JOJOR DERDELE _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

Mr. Ekso is a citizen of Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Deputy Chief  Legislative Appointments Committee of Federal  Government Of Nigeria (G.N) and is also the chief lawyer in Lagos, (Federal  Judicial Services). On June 20, 2000, my client,his wife and their two children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu Lagos Express Road. Unfortunately, their lives were thrown into disarray by the incident. Shortly after the accident, my client got very sick and later died, while the couple's only son and daughter survived the accident. Since then I have been expecting one of my clients who was supposed to come over to Nigeria to claim his money and property left behind by his deceased employer. Unfortunately, we got word that he died leaving no beneficiary to the account. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and the company. My client had an account with one of the leading security and finance Corporation,(C.SC),and the fund is presently with a Finance Company in the US and European, close to the top 2 Government Official(G.NIC) of Nigeria. So, to save the company from total bankruptcy, the government is looking for a reliable foreign partner to assist us in the business, included in the agreement with you, I shall be paid 20% of the total amount, while the remaining 80% will be for the company. All legal documents for this transaction will be carefully worked out including the notarization of your contract and consent of your to enter into the agreement. If you are interested in this business proposition, contact me as soon as possible,through my email address,so that we can go over the business details together. Please contact me by email as soon as possible,so that we can go over the business details together. I shall give you all the contact address for your positive response. Please contact me through my email if you are interested in this deal,I shall give you all the contact address for your positive response.

Dear Dr. Katya Lemnikova,

I have not heard from you for some time. I sent your name, address, and telephone number to your email, but it returned no answer. Maybe this is because I have been too busy or maybe I did not send it.

Dear Mr.Walter.Fischman

This was a reply to my email from yesterday evening  confirming Mr.Fischman's remit as Mr.Gill. I do not recall any having been sent  the previous email confirmation. Is it not possible that your email was forwarded  onto one of the IT staff in London who then  proceeded to mail it to the remit in America?  This email confirmation was sent to you from my  remit in London  today (I do not think I am the only one who received). The email confirmation  confirmed that the email confirmation was sent on an urgent note, no  remit mail (not even to me) had elapsed at the time of sending.

 REPLY URGENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED FROM THE DESK OF GEORGES KABUJI  ABEDI GIRLS BANK OUAGADOU, BURKINA FASO. EQ DOMINANT EMBARRASSMENT SINCE THE FORMATION OF STATE ALLIANCE FOR THE BURKINA FASO, I HAVE BEEN ADVISING BUSINESS CONTRACTORS AND INFLATED CONTRACTS DURING MY EXPERIENCE IN THE BUSINESS WORLD. I PASSED THE TEST OF THE CONTRACTORS WITH THE FOREIGNERS AND MANDATED THEM TO CARRY OUT A CAREFUL AND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF CONTRACTS THAT WERE IN THE PICTURE. DURING THE ABOVE MENTIONED PROCESS, I DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM OF US$15.3MILLION U.S. DOLLARS AND THIRTY-FIVE MILLION U.S. DOLLARS STILL IN PICTURE DURING THE TIME OF EXECUTION WHICH WAS DISCOVERED BY US. THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS (US$15.3MILLION U.S. DOLLARS) FIVE MILLION U.S. DOLLARS ONLY, AND TELEPHONE BILLS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN BURKINA FASO. THE SUM OF US$15.3MILLION U.S. DOLLARS IS A TREASURE AND IT IS NOW USED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES ACCORDING WITH THE YEARS OF THE DEPOSIT FOR TREATMENT. IT IS PRESENTLY BURKINA FASO AND THE FUNDS ARE WITH THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA. HOWEVER, THE FUNDS ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE BECAUSE THE YEARS OF THE DEPOSIT HAS RUN OUT AND THE FUNDS ARE NOW BEING LOOKED FOR IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE ABOVE ARRANGMENT IN THE WEBSITE DISCOVERED BY US PROVED THAT THE FUNDS SHOULD BE REMITTED INTO A NON-TRANSFERABLE ACCOUNT DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE DEPOSIT. THE REASON HOW THE FUNDS ARE BEING REMITTED INTO NON-TRANSFERABLE ACCOUNT INCLUDES THE TIME OF EXECUTION OF THE CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATES THAT IF SUCH A CLAIM HAS BEEN MADE ON A CONTROLLED FUND, THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERED TO A NEW ACCOUNT DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THE CONTROLLED FUND AND THE MANAGER OF THE BANK. THE REQUEST OF A FOREIGN PARTNER IN THIS TRANSACTION IS OCCASIONED AND WE REQUEST YOUR WEBSITE TO DISCUSS ALL MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. MUST THE TRANSFER BE MADE? AT THE PRESENT TIME, THE ABOVE AMOUNT HAS BEEN NET WIDE TOTALLY US$30.5 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS, AND THE NET VALUE HAS BEEN US$20.5 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS. AS IT MAY INTEREST,I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRANSFERING THIS MONEY TO SOME OTHER PERSONAL ACCOUNT DUE TO THE LARGER CONTENT OF THIS MONEY AND THE RISK OF OUR BANK NOT BEING ABLE TO MOVE THE FUND OUT OF BURKINA FASO UNTIL THE TIME OF TRANSFER. HOWEVER,I WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN BURKINA FASO AND AUDITING THE WHOLE SITUATION TO MAKE SURE THE PLACE IS CLEAR BEFORE THE TIME OF TRANSFER. SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR NAME, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING YOUR URGENT RESPONSE. WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU, I WILL GIVE YOU THE LATEST NELSON INFORMATION AS IT MAY BE, BASED ON OUR DISCUSSIONS. I SUGGEST YOU GET BACK TO ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Search!

Title: FOR THE LOVE OF MY FATHER.
 FOR THE LOVE OF MY FATHER. &gt;From The Desk of Meni Lux QC B.O.A (Baro Abahasa) Mani Lux is a lawyer, and a Private Practice Attorney to late Mr. John Bales a citizen of Niger who used to work with Shell Petroleum Development Company in Nigerian. He is survived by his wife and three children. Please, you will find the obituary notice for your perusal on the website below: http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/africa/11/11/kenya.crash/index.html http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1030225.stm Since the untimely passing of his clients father we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our legal documents and policies but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. It is the law and policy here that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe like me can not stand as next of kin to a foreigner. I agree that 30% of this money shall be for you as foreigner partner, in respect to the provision of a non-resident account, 10% shall be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 70% would be for me. Thereafter, I shallvisit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated above and so the sum to be transfered will be as follows: 60% for me, while 10% shall be set aside for expenses incured during the business. Please, you should keep this business proposal very confidential and relevant to your business because of theforeigner in the company,you should not disclose the nature of the transaction to anyone. I expect your urgent reply to this mail by sending me a personal fax number and email address. Due to the urgent nature of this business suggestion, I will appreciate it to keep this transaction secret andrelevant to you. Thanks and God bless.

I  am interested in hearing from others from the  business side of the   energy industry about their  experiences with the  PLS.  I will  send you  a link to a report of the first  PLS meeting.

Title: (RE: OFFER OF A WEEK)
 (RE: OFFER OF A WEEK) Greetings to you, Looking for a partner who can help us out. I am Bill Wilson, a lawyer based in Lagos-Nigeria. I will be contacting you through my personal attorney. I have an urgent and personal business proposition for you. On June 20, 1999, an Iraqi Foreign Worker with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Mahmood al-Wasati, with his entire family perished in a plane crash. Since then, no one knows about this transaction or anything concerning it, as no one has operated on this asides to claim the consignment containing this huge sum of money, which was paid to him as a wedding gift. Before my late client was killed, he moved out this money in cash to a private security company in Europe. And from there it is going into the custody of a security company in Europe. And from there it will be deposited with a private security company. And finally, after six months, the money will be reclaimed from the custody of the security company.

Title: INVESTMENT PROPOSAL.
 INVESTMENT PROPOSAL. FROM:Dr. James Alexander. Tutor, Financial Transformation and Institutions of Last Resort. 186 Corporation Street, Victoria Island, Lagos-Nigeria. Attn: The President. Dear Sir, RE: TRANSFER OF ($10.4MILLION) FOUR MILLION US DOLLARS. I know this letter may come to you as a surprise, but please bear with me and we will go over a very sensible business. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2004, an Iraqi private contractor with the US firm, hired by my firm, made a numbered time (Fixed) contract valued at ($10.4MILLION) US DOLLARS with our Company here in Lagos-Nigeria. According to our documentation, this contract was satisfactorily executed and date stamped. All the contractors that was supposed to make delivery were actually scheduled to receive their paychecks on the 21st of June, 2004. Upon the receipt of the paychecks though, the contractors started to send no funds to the company. The company started to dredge the docks in order to keep the contract documents and documentation valid, but they eventually stopped due to lack of labor force. A closer look at the web site of the main contractor, (http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/africa/12/13/kenya.crash/index.html), and you will see that the site has been completely destroyed by the Nigerian Navy. The government has also begun to investigate on charges that the company did not declare the profits on many contracts it executed in the country. Though it may seem strange to you of whom you know the situation in the world, but when a government official makes a contract with you, it usually means something is amiss. This is why it is essential to have a trusted and reliable person in this transaction, because then the government official can usually be made the beneficiary. For your assistance, I have agreed to pay 30% of the total sum to you, while 10% will be set aside for all the expenses we may incurred during the process of this transaction. You are entitled to 10% of the sum if you agree to perform this service for me. I shall require your full name, address, telephone and fax numbers for easy communication, while giving a few details to give you an idea of what the transaction entails. I will expect your reply to this letter so as to friend me enough to allow me hire your company to collect some time in your company. I expect your response to this letter please, I look forward to your response. Yours Sincerely, Dr.James Alexander. _________________________________________________________________ Don�t just search. Find. Check out the new MSN Search!  http://search.msn.com

Title: TRUST 
 TRUST  Dear Sir, I am Mr.Frederick. I am the manager of breeder of negroes and ...   the owner/ operator of breeder of negroes in NIGERIA. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On May 8, 1999, an American air traffic controller working in the International Air Line Service at LAX11 made an Order in my office to drop all incoming air cargo containing cash totaling US$32M in cash exceeding the stipulated amount of US$32M in cash in an account in my bank.On further investigation it was established that the account belongs to one Mr. Fredy H.   John who was the chief air traffic controller in Lagos, Nigeria and also a contractor with the Nigerian Ministry of Transport in the year 2000.And he died while on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in February,2003.And no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it; all my colleague knows about it is that I witnessed his last rites. Before his death, he deposited the sum of $32M in a private security company in Europe. Even his partner at the time who was with him at the time,jokingly stated that the consignment was in an account that belongs to one of his contractors that died in 2003. And since the death of his contractor, Mr. John, John has been depositing huge sums of money in a single account in Europe. In my office I discovered that the consignment with the amount mentioned above was lodged in a security company which I disclosed to my colleagues. All my colleagues are now waiting to be paid because my colleagues died with the sum of $32M in their account. But before that, it is necessary to disclose to you that if you are not interested in the business, no one will be. I want you to understand clearly that the client is coming from a reputable company and he wants you to treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality because of the amount involved. I want you to know that this transaction is 100% risk free if you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality because of the amount involved. That is why I contacted you for assistance in this regard. I want you to know that this transaction is 100% risk free if you treat it with utmost confidentiality and confidentiality because of the amount involved. As soon as this payment is over, you are expected to apply to the Security Company in Europe for payment according to your investment zone. I shall present you with the application form once I hear from you. Please contact me as soon as possible upon your acceptance of this offer. May God bless the happiness of your life.

 FROM MR.BERNARD LEWIS. I AM THE MANAGER BILL/EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT. OF MY BANK, BANK OF AFRICA (BOA) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO WEST AFRICA. WITH DUE RESPECT I WOULD LIKE TO INVEST SOME MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY.HOWEVER DURING OUR INVESTIGATION AND AUDITING IN THE BANK, MY COMPUTING STAFF CAME ACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON. THE SAID AMOUNT WAS (US$12.5M) TEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY. WHICH WAS PUT TO A TRUNK ACCOUNT IN MY BANK BEFORE THE BANK WAS CONCLUDED. MEANWHILE ALL THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN PUT IN PICTURE, THE ACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS TO PUT CLAIMS AS THE BASIC INFRINGMENT,I WOULD LIKE TO DISCOVER THAT THE SPECULATION INVOLVED IN THE SUM OF ($12.5M) TEN MILLION THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS CAN NOT BE DENIED ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

Dear Bernard Lewis,

I would like you to read an article on China  that I have in The Economist on China that is  very favorable.  It says that a  select company  has the  largest  share  in the market and that  you need to  read it in order to  have  confidence in your  purchasing decisions.  In doing so, I hope that  you don't buy Chinese bonds  that have higher  interest rates  charges on them. Mr.    You have been  very helpful in this  inquiry.  I thank you again.

Title: PLEASE ASSIST US 
 PLEASE ASSIST US  Dear Sir, This mail may come to you as a surprise. I am Barrister Zuma Nuhan Vaye from the South East Asia. I am an attorney and legal practitioner. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On July 8th, 2002, Malaysian Airlines Flight 170 from Amsterdam to Singapore, the passengers on board, that was bound for Singapore, were bombarded with a toxic chemical substance for several days before the medics and the airline staff finally declared the passengers dead on 16th April 2003. since this occurrence my interest is being kept full by the Government of Malaysia Airports in Malaysia, and I have been approached by the Government to seek an assistance to help me in moving the sum of $12.5M (Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). On further investigation and investigation, it was decided by the Government of Malaysia Airports that the passengers were Bounties to play the sum of $12.5M (Twelve Million United States Dollars) in a lottery system, on 15th April 2002, the ticket operator declared the ticket as sold out. Also, it was agreed by the Government of Malaysia Airports that, after the government officially debarred the ticket, I and two other lawyers will be legally permitted to prosecute the ticket on behalf of my client. It was also agreed that, at the conclusion of this business, the ticket would be transferred to any Foreign Bank account we will provide. As You may remember, prior to my legal opinion of the ticket being declared unsold, my client requested that the ticket be played without a ticket. It was actually my turn to provide the legal opinion. I immediately received a phone call from our secured phone, informing me that my client asked for a ticket and that I should present my client to the Foreign Bank as the next of kin to the deceased. At that point, my client was dead, and nothing had happened. My client was in the hospital bed with his head in a tube, and the only person that knew of his existence was my client and his accountant. All documents proving his existence was administered by my client, and the certificate of deposit of the account was with a bank in Europe. The bank has since ascertained that my client died without a body. For now, we need a foreign partner that can provide an account to us, as there are no record of his activities or existence. In the event that you are interested in assisting us, we shall furnish you with more details and how we intend to proceed. Please contact us as soon as possible with your telephone number and fax number for easy communication. Regards, Barrister Zuma Nuhan Vaye.

Dear Sir/Madam,  I am  MAMA  KAYANE, THE MANAGER BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPT. IN THE NIGERIA WELFARE CENTRE. I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRANSFERING THE LEFT OVER SUM OF US$23.MILLION (TWENTY- EIGHT MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS ). THIS MONEY WAS DISGUISED AND SHIPPED TO ONE OF THE EUROPEIAN COUNTRY BY THE TIME WE ARRANGED TO BRING THIS FUND. HOWEVER DUE TO THE DISTURBANCE THE FUND HAS BEEN INCREASED IN SALES DURING THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION AND REVIEWING OF APPLICATIONS, WE SAW THE AMOUNT OF TOKENS CONSIGNED AND SENT OUT TO SEIZE THE PROGRESS. WE ARE STILL ASSURING THE COMPLETE COMPLEMENT OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE IS NO TRACE OF THE CONTRACT. WHEN THE BUSINESS IS COMPLETED AND WITHIN A FEW MONTHS THE LEFT OVER SUM WILL BE REMITTED TO THE LEFT OVER BANK. CONSIDERING THE DANGEROUS NATURE OF TRANSFER OF THIS ACCURACY, WE SAW THE RISK OF OVERSEASING OF THE MONEY DUE TO VINDICTIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ARE BENT ON DEALING WITH THIS LOT OF US,BECAUSE THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS THIRTY TWO MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS. WE SAW THE IMMUNITY OF THE BUSINESS WITH THE BANK AND DID NOT SUSPEND THE APPLICATION, SINCE WE REACHED BANKED UNDER OUR CONTROL. IT IS FROM OUR REASON THAT I AND OTHER OFFICIALS IN MY  DEPARTMENT ARE NOW SEEKING FOR YOUR CO-OPERATION TO CARRY OUT THE PROCESS OF THE TRUNK LOT AND INVEST $15.5 MILLION (FIFTY M (FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS )) DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER. IT WILL BE USED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES IN NIGERIA DUE TO THE RISK MODE OF THIS BUSINESS. CONCLUSIVELY, IT IS OUR PLEASURE TO OFFER YOU 25% OF THE TOTAL SUM, WHICH I COULD SINCERELY EXPECT FROM YOU DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER DUE TO SAFE KEEPING THE ACCOUNTS IN US TO A SAFE LEVEL OF 3,500 (USD) PER DAY, DURING THE COURSE OF THE BUSINESS.

Title: ASSISTANCE
 ASSISTANCE Dear Sir/Madam I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. I am a citizen of  Iraq by name Abdul Kadib.I work in the Iraqi private and federal  contract industry here in Baghdad.Before the onset of the war in Iraq I was  Plenipotentiary to the then Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.And before his  last breaths he ordered all my colleagues to leave the country as soon as possible.I  and i carried out an analysis and discovered an abandoned sum of $20.5million dollars (Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only)in an account that belongs to one of  our foreign contractors who died with his entire family in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 253. My  analysis proved to me that he died without making a WILL,and all our official documents relating to his death are  still with us.And since then i have made several inquiries with the Federal Government of Iraq to come forward and claim this money, but  sadly we are told that he is dead as well. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my  department now decided to make this business proposal to you and to get your cooperation so that we can  transfer this money into your private banking account. We have all the documents that will empower you as the original- beneficiary to claim this money. We have decided to compensate you with 10%of the total amount for your collaboration. Please get in touch with me as soon as possible so that we can go over this business deal and find a solution that will be mutual.

Dear Mr. Tamim Abdul Kadib,
 
 I have to make a suggestion on the matter. Please advise as to whose account this is in and who it will be used in (if it's not yours).  It would be interesting to spend the evening with the owner and his family.  Do you have any information on Mr. Khadri?
  
 Thanks,
 
 Love,
 
 Kim

 Can you tell I am the one you spoke with yesterday and that I am the one you
 spoke to.  I hope that is good, your   
 interest piqued by the fact that this is going to be a lecture for a class that  
 would normally have had a 1:00 or two pm lecture? 
 
 Do you want me to use your name, or do I want the

Dear Mr. Smith:

I have attached a copy of the letter addressed to you from our lawyer.  It explains the requirements for a business proposal.  I did not receive it but am sure you have the attached letter.  It provides us with the date of commencement of the petition, time limit for commencement of the business proposal and the time of the commencement of the business proposal.  I need to check the letter again for the original. I am sure we do not have amendments made to the above letter.  Please advise as to the original signature date and legal description of the document before I am sure that it is yours.  I will call you with more detail later today.

Best,

Jan Jharkhand

I also need your strong assurance that you will never let me down In this regards I have decided to compensate your efforts with 25% of the total money while 5% is set aside to defray all incidental processing charges and tax in your country. Please reply to this email if you are interested in assisting me by reference #imp_quijote@yahoo.com.hM until we can establish a nerve with you. With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account whom you can arrange for the actual funds. I have everything required to execute this deal smoothly.

 ATTN:MD DR THE MANAGER, PLEASE READ AND RESPOND Dear, I greet you in the name of God Almighty and my prayers are with you as we await your positive response. My name is Dr. James Cook from Saumur, Ghana, a Protestant minister by profession and a member of the church since 1853 until his death on 31st October 2006. Before his death on 31st October 2006, he was Bishop of Lagos in position of Bishop, and having held the office of Bishop since 1973, he was married to three wives, namely: Nancy, Margaret and Louisa. Their first husband was General Francis Cook who served in the Government under the leadership of the late president of Ghana, General Sani Abacha. In the early of the year of our Lord (2005), my wife Margaret and I moved to Dakar-Senegal with our three children in the intention of travelling to Europe or any other country of which we are informed by the ministry of the church we are now leaving with. We decided to change our names and so that we could better stand out as an identity group from the defectors from the church. We soon discovered that the Trans-Atlantic Airlines (T.A.B) flight that we had been intending to use to travel to any country we will be chartering, was cancelled due to lack of passengers. My son-in-law and I, now act as the guardians of this trust, made up our minds to change our names so that we could travel to any country we will be chartering as the new identity group so we could better stand out as an identity group from the defectors. We decided to change our names to: James, James and James Cooks meaning that we want to secure this new position of trust in your company for our future investments and also for the sake of our children's future. We will offer you 20% of the proceeds of this transaction for your assistance. We have decided to use this new opportunity to ask for your assistance in the matters we intend to do for you. We are prepared to compensate you with a percentage of your salary as compensation for any inconvenience that may occur during the process of this transaction. Please, treat with utmost secrecy and confidentiality in all matters concerning this matter, as you would be rewarded accordingly. Your contact address: +232-797-111466.Thank you, Dr. James Cook.

Dear OUMARU NEMANI, Thank you for the email that you have given us.  Although the message is short, I believe it to be a very informative article on the subject of currency in our bank.  It would be very interesting to read the article in our banks.  You have given me access to the financial magazine, The Economist.  They have an article on currency.  I am interested in the article below (the editorials are somewhat controversial) as we are going to discuss the following issues: 1.    Is the money supply in India a significant driver of interest on the currency page? 2.    Is the currency price driven by a major driver of interest on the currency page?  3.    Does the money flow from a high tolerance/high velocity currency page (like India) have more relevance than low tolerance currency pages?   For example we have talked about the risk that India faces as a currency user. 4.    To what extent does the editorials themselves matter?  For me the important thing is to understand where they are coming from.  For this we are already in the process of reviewing the issues so please feel free to give me your thoughts & suggestions as to where you would like us to discuss currency/GMC page. My email and phone number are

Dear Mr. Newman,

You are welcome to attend the second of two  meeting between June 3 and July 1,  at your convenience.

Please note that the meeting will  be tape-recorded and  should be completed by the end of Monday.

I am available to answer any questions you may have about the energy issue  and to provide  specific location of  the energy meeting. If you have  a  time and a place to attend the  meeting, I would  be glad to have you attend  the recording.

It is my understanding that this meeting will not  focus on the ""energy question"" but rather  on     broader     market    dynamics.

Title: GOOD DAYS
 GOOD DAYS Dear Sir, I am Prof.Neil Diamond, the Auditor General of Alhaji Bank of Al-Hijaz,A suburb of Al-Hijaz, in the province of Diyala. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $US15 million dollar (Fifteen million US dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on 31st October,2003 in a plane crash in Cotonou - Benin. You shall read more stories about the crash on visiting this site:(http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/10/26/benin.crash) and (http://www.wral.com/news/16320517/detail.html). Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin(his Only Son and Daughter) died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this situation behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a resident of Benin Republic of Benin and a local farmer, while the customer was also a resident of Benin Republic of Benin. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was also unemployed and retired from the service of the Bank. I agree that 30% of this money shall be for you as foreign partner, while 10% shall be set aside for expenses incurred during the business. I will seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this transaction can be paid to you, while the remaining 70% shall be for me. You should note that a fixed deposit is a security mechanism under which the fund is lodged and it is only the account owner who can authorize the movements of the money. I will provide the instructions to enable you obtain the money in your account as arranged.Should you be interested,please reply urgently so that I will send you the detailed instructions.Thanks for your co-operation and I shall give you the detailed instructions as soon as I receive your response. Yours faithfully, Dr.Neil Diamond ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://yoursite.com

Dear Prof.Neil Diamond,

Here are a few other interesting stories you may have heard that may shed some light on the facts you claim to know. 

1 - You said that the only way you could be sure about this wasn't with a test is with  the testimony (which you've  had) that the test  was done by the  analyst  on your staff members.  I think I have  a 95%  chance that the  analyst's  test is correct. 
 
 
 2 - You say it looks unlikely the analyst will  give full  deposition (due to NDA)  on the issue of trading floor latency because  NDA is not a  requirement.  However if the analyst  is 100% sure this  wasn't done,  then he will  certainly  report the trade floor latency issue, but will  the full  deposition be admissible. 
 
 3 - The only other source you've  heard that  has  been able  to confirm your hypothesis is a  person who is familiar with those  operations who  has experience  management  in the  area (NDA,  trade floor  latency  management, etc.). What do  you think of this  ?

I'll try to be available to do full  deposition, but if anything  prevents you, please let me know. 

Best  regards,

Darrell

PS A thought for those interested:  Are you guys able to get the slides on your  analyst  during your  5 min session today ? You hear NOLM say  that the analyst may have some  doubts if they take the material all the way through ?

Your reply must contain your cell telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. I will need your full name, address, and company or residential or company address.

Dear Mr.Inglis,
 
 
 
 Today was a difficult day, to say the least.  It started off easy for me as you will recall.
 
 
 The first presentation  as I remember, 
 was the following presentation ?
  ? ""Market Based Valuation For Large Cap U.S. Markets - Part I ""
 ?   The second presentation was actually a little bit more technical in nature, but more about the technical aspects.

Title: Please Contact me
 Please Contact me Dear, Sir, I am Your loyal and humble servant in this my condition. I am alhaji bintus the only son of late Colonel Edwards bintus the former senior military adviser to the president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, late president Goodluck Jonathan.It may be strange to you of what my situation is really like. I am currently residing with my father in Zaire and have just been recently granted political asylum by the Federal Government of Zaire. In the year 2000, the head of state, president Jonathan had to abdicate office because of charges of Cash Fraud. He was accused of secretly owning $35m US Dollars(Thirty million united states dollars) as cash. It was alleged that during his term as president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, he deposited some amount of money with a security company in Europe. This amount was determined to be somewhere between $15.3m US Dollars and $35m US Dollars. I am only 22years old and really don't know what to do or how to get out from here.  I don't want to go back to Africa where therefore I wants to go to Europe to seek political asylum. My father told me that before he died he was able to move out some amount of money with a security company in Europe which is still in the custody of the Finance House, that amounts to about $1.3million US Dollars. I am only 22years old. I got your contact address from a directory on the internet, after a little research I decided to contact you for assistance in securing a valid form of international travel document to enable us move this money out of Africa to your country. You will be allowed to keep 20% of the money for yourself and the rest for me. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up claims we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I look forward to your soon reply via mail. Yours in standing,                                               BOUAKE, SOUTH AFRICA. _________________________________________________________________ Express yourself instantly with MSN Search!

Dear Dr. Steven Nand,

Thank you very much for taking your time to look over my resume.  As mentioned on our last phone, my name was Steven Nand.  I was the Senior Managing Director for the Global Power division, International Monetary Fund (IMF) West Africa, Federal Government Of West Africa, and my company is currently in charge of the Global Markets division.

I understand that the purpose of the interview was to 
 get an inside look as to how the firm is doing and what they want to do with 
 this business.  However, do not worry yourself with the 
 question of what kind of advice I should expect.  Instead,
 let me know what to expect.  In the mean time, would you 
 mind doing me a favor and filling out the following?       I can be of these offices as often as I want but most 
 of the time by May-June, this office will be closed and that will help 
 me in my search.  I am sure they would appreciate that.

Vince

Dear Mr. Giri, thank you for your splendid 
 greeting. I look forward to your reply 
  on my behalf.  If you have been sitting around
 waiting all morning, don't worry. I'm 
 going to put the reply in right away.  My
 work load has increased by 5% to be ready in 
 about 30 minutes.  I'm going to check the information 
 to see exactly what you have to  respond to make sure you

Dear mr peter daniel:

Thank you for taking time to visit our website.  As I noted in my previous e-mail (http://es.akama-s.com/? http://es.akama-s.com/) you now have two choices when it comes to investing in a company; ""You know me, I bet you/you have already invested in the company and would I have a problem with it"" or ""You are an experienced investor and do not want to  have a problem with this company but understand that it is a new entrant into the market.""

I know you have invested a great deal of time and money into a company and have  really enjoyed the service.  However, I need to have a few  question marks regarding your experience.  If you can answer one, I would greatly appreciate you making it  known to me.  Please let me know.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you.

Dear Vince,

Thank you for coming to Enron HQ on May 8.  It is really neat being up there working from home.  You can get your ""home office"" from within  the Enron Portal (as ""enron.""com"").   It�s in the west end of the HQ, on the  second floor, in the Business Center.  It�ll be easy to find.  We have some big  announcements on the 9th  through 12th to make  our home office available.  I also need to make sure that I am not in  the habit of leaving my home in San Francisco to come back  here.  This is only for 6 days.    I am out for 3 days after that.  I don't know what the  news will be like the second  week  (May 9).   If we do it again, do you know when I can  return?  Or will you just keep me at home for a day?  I'm so  excited. And it is only July 4.   I am  trying to have my honeymoon  come up.  Can you please let me know your thoughts on the  idea of returning on  Monday the 18th?  Since

Title: PROPOSAL
 PROPOSAL Dear Friend I am Mr. KONE,the Auditor General of  the German Federal Ministry of Finance. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $15 Million US Dollars(USD) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2000 in a plane crash.Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.I agreed that 25% of this money will be for you as foreigner partner, 75% will be for me and my colleagues while 5% will be set aside for all the expenses we incurred during the transaction.My role in this transaction is that I will stand as beneficiary and manager of this fund while the rest will be for me and my colleagues.The transaction has to be concluded before the end of the year 2000, when the new president of the republic of Ghana, General Sanogo Dos Santos takes office, I will be working with my colleagues to transfer this money to any country of your choice, where the money will be safe and we can fully operationalize this fund. As soon as this money gets to your country, you are expected to apply to the bank as next of kin to the deceased for the transferal of the fund, as indicated in our banking guidelines. As soon as you receive this letter, kindly send me your private telephone and fax number for easy communication. If you are interested, contact me through my private email address or my office phone and fax number. Thanking for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to you. KONE. ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://yoursite.com

Dear kone ,

You have probably already heard about the meeting in Frankfurt this saturday and how my colleague Guido van Rossum expressed interest in the proposal.  I am writing you this message to update you on this proposal.  

I am currently working my full time here at the firm as a research person but the time we will be  meeting saturday is for 3 person teams.  This  is true for the London team but they  can handle 2 or more?  They are required to call  us to discuss this proposal but only one team will be allowed to  attend  for one hour.  I am sure  that you cannot let a member or former employee handle this  proposal as you would not like them to be seen as the facilitator  in  the meeting on the saturday  meeting.  I  have assured her that this proposal is not for sale and that she can  let one person handle this initiative. 

If you have not informed them in advance of this meeting what would you  like to be present for the meeting and any  co-ordinator of this initiative ?

I am sure that we can meet  with no problem and if you  wish that we can, then you are free to inform the person  you want to  meet on the 15th at our office.  The problem we will be  facing is that  the UK is about to have the 1st of May  a Eurobond network  launched and to put that network together would require some  of our people have to be in the building on the first  of the  May.   I hope you are having fun in your  trip  and I will get a good long term arrangement with your  company so that the work I do will be done in London  and not in NY for example

 URGENT REPLY NEEDED MR.B.O.S G.R.O.S,                                       (RE: URGENT REPLY)  Dear Sir, Although this mail may come to you as a surprise, I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. My name is Mr.B.O.S, I work with a bank here in Ghana and one of our accounts with holding balance of $10 million has been dormant and has not been operated for the past 3 years. &gt;From the date of establishment of this account in 2000, the owner of the said account Mr. A.S.Wu, a foreigner, an accountant with the Korean Ministry of Commerce and Trade, has been staying in the country with his family since 1995. His late wife died in the plane crash of Korean Air Line 405 with their three children on the 31st of March 2002.After the death of his late wife and son, Mr. A.S.Wu made up his mind to move the funds to a hidden account outside the country because he is afraid that whoever will claim this money will try and execute this order, which he wrote down in his log book, on depositing of the funds, on his going through a mailing list forsuggested sources of funds.After his death, no one has come forward to claim this money because he has no next of kin,and the bank cannot launch legal proceedings against him because he is a foreigner. He also wrote down the sum $10.5 million in our account as unused fund in his log book. Even if I do not claim this money from his side, the bank will continue to service our account because we are civil/political/civil servants.I don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.I also want to keep this money in a safe abroad, for the safety of my career. I need a reliable person in this business because I need a trusted and well-informed person in this business. If you are interested in this business, you send me your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication. Upon your response,you will be given the opportunity to negotiate your mode of share. I must also inform you that 40% of the money will go to your nominated bank in any bank of your choice where the rest of the money will be kept until we sign a binding agreement on your behalf.I will be waiting for your response . For more informations please check this site. &gt;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=569261 Please, response with your confidential phone and fax numbers to also allow me a space to talk to you.  Thank you. Regards, MR.B.O.S. BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)

 URGENT REPLY NEEDED. URGENT REPLY NEEDED. URGENT REPLY NEEDED. Fadzul Salahi Bank Of Africa Burkina Faso. Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso West Africa. Attention: The Director. I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of Bank Of Africa. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of One hundred and twenty seven million United State Dollars. US$US$1,000,000.00 (U.S.$1,000.000.00) on a trunk box that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin(his wife and his two children) died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials of my department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it with the documents or certificates of deposit for the claim. We agree that 25% of this money would be for you as foreign partner, while the balance would be for the expenses incurred during this transaction. We will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated above. We will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% hitch-free on both sides. There is no risk involved in this transaction and the business can be completed under the supervision of a lawyer. Should you be interested in participating in this transaction, give me your details and about you/your company. As soon as you receive this letter, provide me with your contact address, Tel, Fax and Email address. I shall send you all the necessary documents that will enable you get in touch with me. I look forward to a favorable outcome to this transaction. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.

Title: PROPOSAL
 PROPOSAL Dear Friend, I am Martinsa Boga the wife of Mr. John Boga from Sierra Leone. I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person to assist in this proposal I have for you. My husband was falsely accused of plotting to remove the head of state Ahmed Tejan Kabbah from office in Sierra Leone. My husband died during one of the fighting between the rebels and the federal government forces of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah on April 14, 2003. You can verify this from some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below: (I)http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-04-15-sierra-leone.html Before his death, he confided in me the last time he was at my house that he had a sum of $5.5 million dollars left behind in a Security Company here in Conakry. (II) http://www.news24.com/Story.asp?ArticleId=1005 Before his death, he instructed me to look for a trustworthy person to assist me in this transaction because he did not know who will be involved in the claim of this money, he instructed me to look for a reliable and reputable person who will help us claim this money from the Security Company. I am sending this letter to solicit for your assistance in this regard. Please, you have to assure me that you will refrain from any breach of the law of our country and that you will not sit on this money when you claim it. Also, be prepared to supply me with your full particulars,telephone and fax numbers for easy communication and location where in the money is. For your reliable assistance, I will compensate you with 15% of the money. Hopefully we can have a long relationship together. Kindly contact me through my email address marminsboga001@yahoo.com Yours faithfully, Martinsa Boga.

Please, inform your superior and forward it to him  (Cc:        I. Kabbah).

This proposal has to be submitted to me by   June 12, 2003 so it is not good to get any   earlier than that.

Title: ATTENTION!!!
 ATTENTION!!! From: MS.KARLA REU
ATTENTION!!! ATTENTION!! I am Mrs. KARLA REU working as an Attorney. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 5, 2000, an American Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian National Interests Quarries, Mr. James Brumley made a fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, valued at US$19.3M (Twenty three million three hundred thousand U.S Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity several notices were sent to him, even after several years have passed. Finally, on March 24, 2009, the Department of Public Works in Nigeria made appointment for a routine inspection of the Baggage Claim Company in Abidjan to serve as the beneficiary/next of kin, but unfortunately they discovered that Mr. Brumley deposited the sum of US$19.3M (Twenty Three million Three Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) with a bank in Abidjan. While on the process of being declared surplus by the Nigerian government, he was arrested and tried for tax evasion. On further investigation, it was also discovered that Mr. Brumley deposited the sum of US$19.3M (Twenty Three million Three hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) with two Bank in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire) one of which is in the name of his first wife and the other in the name of his second wife. Both of them died while on the process of being declared surplus by the Nigerian government. It was also discovered that Mr. Brumley deposited the sum of US$19.3M (Twenty Three million Three Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) with one Bank in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire) as the beneficiary/next of kin. I am presently awaiting information from you as to your interest in obtaining the sum of US$18.3M (Twenty three million three hundred thousand U.S Dollars) for your successful contribution to the project of my bank. I have considered the money highly classified for security reasons and will use it to promote my business in your country. To enable the immediate transfer of this money to you as soon as possible. You will be entitled to 20% of the total sum for your assistance.I have all the necessary information needed to transfer this money to you. I would simply require a visa to enable the bank transfer the money to you. Please get in touch with me as soon as you receive this message via my personal email address: karla_reu2000@yahoo.co.uk I look forward to a very successful business relationship with you.

Hi bud...

The reason I brought up today's meeting in your e-mail was to  remind you all how cool it is to meet people.  I am not saying you will know  or like everyone here.  I simply that we are all in the minority and that we shall  meet more people along the way...most of us are from the tech and business worlds.....not a  stranger...the only thing I am told are you are from the business world...so you have some  familiarity with the  world and the people in it.  However, please note the business and  not the tech person here.   I have met these people many, many times in my various  businesses..and still haven't heard one of them use the word ""friend"" -  however, he did mention how they are both in  Palo Alto and that they speak Italian with a German accent.....I hope this  doesn't come across as a snob!

Have a nice evening......and have a nice day.

Yours,

Title: INVESTMENT PROPOSAL
 INVESTMENT PROPOSAL Sir,  I am Mr. W.  BILL ANDON, Minister of Sport and Harnessing in Nigeria.   In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 22 million US Dollars (Twenty two million US Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer deceased. The account name is Mr. John Moran a citizen of  Brazil, who was a petroleum engineer by profession but also an oil merchant in Lagos who was active in several Nigerian Petroleum  Contractor and supplier to US Petrochemical Service and others. On further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. John was a Foreign contractor to the Nigerian Ministry  of petroleum Resources and a paid interpreter for the Brazilian President of the Federal  Republic of Nigeria, Mr. Lula da Silva. At the time of his death, Mr. John was living in Lagos and making plans to move to Lagos to take residence in the United  States of America. His employer, the Brazilian Petroleum and Chemical Service, does not know about this account or any part of it and has  the account closed down and the record of the account is sealed. This sum of US$22.5 million can not be claimed by my government because I am still in office as the Minister, I am the only one who knows about this account and i will demand that all the account documents be re-opened for transfer of the money to another government account or to  any account of your choice where the fund will be safe. The sum of US$22.5 million is cashed and the sum of US$9 Million is still floating in a Security Company in Europe.   I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the government is now 100% sure that I am the person who  did this,they have concluded  legal proceedings against me,among other things they wish to do.   Your fee will be used to build a relationship with my government which is needed in the near future. I thank you in advance and shall let you know how much I appreciate your assistance. Please contact me immediately on my private email address above  to enable us discuss more.   Yours sincerely,   W.B.

In addition, we would  like to indicate  NR within the credits, unless  the student  states otherwise.  For example,   If I were presenting, and my colleague stated  that NR will be presented by the end of the  course, which does not happen, I would like  to indicate  NR at the start of the credits, and  NR  after the credits. I hope  that this is helpful.

Regards, 

P.S. I would like to thank you for your work  during last winter. All of  these employees want a piece of the
 pie :-).  If you do not know me, I may be the first 
 employee to refer to you.

We look forward to  meeting in person next month,

Mike

Dear sissi,

We continue to work closely with you on this project.  We are happy to inform you that the project is already well advanced (a few of our people will get involved).  You may find that it would provide lots of benefit for the project.  If you want to remain anonymous and be sure that we will not publish your email, please feel free to send it to a single email address. 

In an ideal scenario we would like to finish as part of the ""real"" project (i.e. working with your team) and be able to publish my email to your corporate accounts.  However it looks like the best option remains with you in the scenario that we are part of a real project with all the details, i.e. not having to ""confirm"" a full release.

Regards,

In a similar fashion to how we would handle the release of a product, let's work together on this.  We would like to start with you as lead and work with you over the next few months to develop a release schedule.  Let me know how you would describe the product and how I (as the lead) can help (as noted in last week's reply).

Sincerely,

The desk that the president and CEO used to meet with the prime minister was changed to the desk that the chairman used to meet with the CEO.  If this is not the desk where they met please write to the President and CEO on 2 February, 1802 at the Presidential Palace, Pune, Uttar Pradesh.

If we send the correct reply today the president will get a new number for the desk that they were meeting on and the CEO will know that he/she is in the right room.

I wish to obtain your consent to present you as next of kin to my late client Mr. Pervez Khadafy, a national of your country and a resident of London, England. Mr. Khadafy was an Iraqi Foreign lecturer at Birmingham University and also a material producer in the céce market. He was assassinated on January 2nd 2003 by two suicide bombers as he was about to give a speech concerning the need for international cooperation in dealing with Iraq. For more details about the event and the assassination, you can log on to, http://www.crocnews.com/story/2003/1/13/51213.html Since then, nobody has come to claim the money or claim the house as the next of kin of Mr. Khadafy, which means that the liberal international community cannot legally transfer the money and property left behind by my client before the commencement of war, which is why I am contacting you for a solution. I have considered the fact that my client was a liberal individual and if I do not claim this money it will be confiscated and declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged. Also, the corporate structure of the bank where this deposit were lodged does not allow such deposits to be lodged more than four times in a calendar year. In order to avert this situation, I propose a temporary suspension of the account and the transfer of the funds and property left behind by my client before commencement of war. I will expect your response by sending to me your private phone &amp; Fax number, where you can be reached in the event of non-availability.

Title: From Mrs. kim how are you?
 From Mrs. kim how are you? Dear Sir, I am Mrs. kim 1958 a widow to late Mr. Morris Reed who was murdered in the conflicts of sierra Leone and Liberia. I am contacting you believing you are a honest and trustworthy person, therefore I will like to introduce myself to you. My husband was a war veteran who served with the United Nations International Mission in Liberia. On August 25, 2003, Mr.began his second tour of duty in Liberia when he came under fire from the Liberian National Resistance Committee. As he approached the end of his second tour, he was killed in a battle. After his death, I became ill and spent most of my time in the hospital. After about two months, my husband died along with about 30 other members of the UNMISS ICTC. Since then I have been put under house arrest by the Liberia government. My situation in the country is not good, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the authorities of the government of Liberia. My late husband was a very wealthy businessman and he has over US$25.5Million (Twenty Five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) deposited with a security company in the names of my three sons. The government of Liberia does not know about this and I don't want them to know about this, I want them to know that my husband was a patriot and I want them to be thankful that I am alive now. I want my children to know that I love them and that I am not afraid to say what I believe in. I want them to know that I am capable of doing what is necessary and right. I want them to know that I have a plan B if things get dire, that I have an A and that I will back up what I say with facts and reason. I want them to know that I will always be praying for them because I know God is with them and that He will never let me down either now or in the future. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because my health,with God I am well. As soon as I hear from you, I will provide you with the details and the plan . Please treat this as confidential and urgent. Kindly send your full contact address,telephone and fax number to my private email address kimkim58@satellite-mail.com.

Dear kim 1958: I know you always wanted to say that I was very concerned for your health, but I assure you that I was not! We had lunch together several months back and you assured me that your husband was doing well. He told me that your first husband was much worse, and that he was more afraid of you. I didn't think that either of them would be able to stand one-on-one contact. Well, he was right. He said the first time I told him that I had had a problem with my voice, which is a very common problem for couples, he told me I sounded harsh and harsh.  I told him, I don't mind talking about it. It is fine.  He is very interested in what I have to say.  We have discussed it before but were not able to come to any agreement. We'll try to reach an agreement at some later date.  I know your husband is doing great. Your kids are doing well, too.  They were even up in the new place (Bali) in August...I got all of them in.  I don't miss the old place any more, though I do miss the kids. I am doing fine (except for one day I am on the road for a week and then I can't work). It is going really well for you. Let's try to keep the kids close. Do have some problems...and not just with your husband.  The kids are very worried about yours.  I am pretty worn out being on the road, so I will probably do less of this stuff for a while. I think I am getting my fitness levels back.  And I need some rest! Hope you are doing great. In any event, I will try to call you in a couple weeks. Again, good luck with you and God bless! Kim

Title: IMMEDIATE REPLY NEEDED.
 IMMEDIATE REPLY NEEDED. I am George Dembé, the accountant general of the Central Bank of Nigeria. He succeeded in getting the funds that belong to my client the former chairman of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Sani Abacha, who died in 2nd of October 1999, here in Nigeria. You shall read more about the Abacha family  crisis on this website:  http://www.ngr.net/abacha099.htm Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claims of these funds, as his next of kin, this is why I contacted you for your assistance to claim the funds as close of kin to the deceased. The monetary amount involved is (USD Ten Million United States Dollars Only)   $10.5M (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) As you may know, the laws and constitution of Nigeria do not allow citizens of country to open account in this central bank so I need your consent to account for me here in Nigeria. If you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency send me an email, indicating your details, your banking address, telephone and fax numbers for easy communication and also your Family Name, if any. I shall then forward your information to the accountancy firm for further instructions including the source of the funds. The banking law and constitution of Nigeria do give legal rights to all citizens over 18 years of age to have bank accounts and foreign exchange accounts, so this is necessary to enable me start preparations for an accountancy firm in your country. If you agree to my terms, I will furnish you with the address where the account is registered. You can contact me through my email, on the contact page. Thanks and God bless, George Dembé ___________________________________________________________________________ Mail sent from WebMail service at PHP-Nuke Powered Site - http://yoursite.com

Dear George Dembé of Nigeria,

This is the final page we would like to share with you the best option for the immediate transfer of funds from a customer account.

I'm the financial controller that has the knowledge on the financial transactions that customer is requesting a manual transfer of funds from credit card to debit card account. I've done all the necessary procedures and will be glad to be able to assist your group in transferring funds in the future on this service. I am very interested in your experience and will be glad to get back to you in due time. If your bank has the option to take the account, we would recommend it. 

Please pass along our feedback to the appropriate banks as per the above link, they can do their own credit card and debit card transactions as well as credit card transactions.

I know that we have had successful service with KFC, we have the following bank accounts: 

KFC                                                KFC                                                  - KFC                             KFC                                                                   - KFC                                                                             - KFC

Dear Miss Dembé, I do have the necessary documentation and would like to request your email address in the next 24 seconds to which I will add the email address of my contact at the Nigeria Bank.

Title: Pictures of you
 Pictures of you Dearest One, Please this letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners. I am The Duke of Burgundy,the second son of late King Charles X. My birth father was the former Royal Minister of Petroleum and Resources in charge of petroleum resources in abidjan, the homelands of Benin Republic. We were the only children of late Mr. and Mrs. Charles X,my mother was a strict religious fundamentalist who believed that God only intended for man to serve God and man was made in God's image. My father was falsely accused of plotting to remove the head of state Charles X from power. My mother was able to persuade the French government to hand him over to the government of President Charles X for trial. Presently, he is in jail facing war crime charges for allegedly ordering the death of his business associates. My father used my name as my only relation in securing the necessary documentations to obtain the documents that would enable him transfer out the sum of$21.5 million dollars (Twenty five million five hundred thousand United State Dollars) from one security company in continental Europe. My father really wanted to present himself as the new head of state but he was secretly arrested by the French authorities while he was on a visit to abidjan. Although he is currently in prison awaiting trial. I am presently undergoing treatment for cancerous ailment and need medical attention. My condition is very critical. As soon as my doctor confirms that I am not going to die, I will like you to send to me the contact details of a psychiatrist that will explain more on how we can proceed. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free. Kindly send me your contact details along with your full name and address, telephone and fax numbers, so that i can give you more directions on how to proceed.

Dear The Duke Your wish arrived today!!!!
 
 I hope that you were able to see our DVD player
 The Movie Theaters !!!.  Have
 been trying for the last 3 weeks to see them but it
 been hard to find  somewhere to watch a movie  (not that you  have seen a  lot of movies).  We
 want you to come see us,
 
 I hope you don't mind some people are trying to see
 us and some others have left.  I am
 sure there is a  good number of other places in downtown 
 Houston that are not far from the pictures shown here.  In
 addition, I
 will have a few other customers over the weekend and hope  you  have a  time to see them.  It
  is just a short drive  from our new office.  I 
 can't wait to see some of the pictures that I
 take at work.
 
 As for your visit to us, I am sure that you would 
 like to see what Houston has to offer, particularly
 the movies 
 and the new businesses 
 that have emerged over the past few years. 
 I look forward to seeing you have a 
 great week.
 My friends 
 are very excited for me when I tell you
 about the 
 graduation party (that will also be 
 March 4).  What with the 
 being to be a senior, I look forward to 
 sharing 
 with them how 
 I am the one that they call on Friday to ask me to 
 be a 
 guest speaker to some business class.
 
 In the next couple  month's, we will 
 have the time and opportunity to 
 meet some more.  I 
 will be in Houston during these 
 dates to support the graduating class 
 and encourage 
 business students, graduates and those in 
 business that are taking the ""short course"" to give their 
 talk.  
 Best, 
 J Denton

Email:wahili_at_pacific_email@tiscali.co.uk Dear Sir,              (RE:PROPOSAL) We are deeply involved in this request.We have in our possession a file, A datum (a file) in our foreign remittance department that consists of a sealed and confidential cable  which was sent to a foreigner by our foreign remittance director. On the 21st of August 2000,an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr.David Roberts made a numbered time (Fixed) order for fourteen (14)pence sterling  to be paid into our foreign remittance department, we arranged for an audit to be carried out on the contract and found out that the total contract cost to him was US$12 million US dollars and was finally approved.  Your name and address as the foreigner will assist in the audit. After the contract was finally approved by our foreign remittance director, we removed the sealed envelope containing the order form and the document signed by the contractor, and in the presence of my clerk he was able to slide the order form out of the file and show me who he was claiming it from. I made comments in the file that the order should be claimed by a lawyer and that the Nigerian government does not approve contract for foreigners to do contract work, therefore I will like you to send me the information as the beneficiary of the contract to claim the contract from the The government. The contract can be claimed by mail, fax number or e-mail address, your company name, your direct phone and fax number and your company's address. If you are interested, I would need from you the following information: Your full name and address, full company name and address, private telephone and fax numbers.

Dear Brother 

You have earned the respect of a number of persons in your long 
 service, and your appearance in the London 
 Law School workshop gave a good impression. I was struck 
 by the fact that you are a brother man, and have come to 
 know you as a successful London lawyer. I 
 would be glad to 
 meet you at your   leisure to discuss the 
       details of a contract (or any other legal matter, 
 especially since you can   talk about it without    going to London).

Dear Mr. Steve,

Thank you for responding ""please respond"" to my message and I think  I am in a rather privileged position to  have any such view.  As I have mentioned before, the first URGENT REQUEST I  received was back from a customer complaining that there were  many orders and that there was no information to  reply to.  Well, I have  received a reply, which states the following.      I have no intention of doing that, even if  it does not require the reply.  I am sorry that such an issue is  presented, but I was travelling today and  having  several cases at first hand.      Will you be able to look at my documents and  verify that there is no information  to reply to.    Please advise as to what  is required and advise that you accept such  documents even if  some or all of the requirements are fulfilled if I  agree.  We   also  request that you send the original  document to us as proof that I have read them, and to confirm that the  owner is indeed you and your representative, and that I  will be able to provide such  evidence if so asked.  This  does  leave me short of what I propose to  deliver, since the  original document needs to be sent to the relevant  place as proof.  Please  advise  me as to what I am to  deliver or where you would  like it  signed.  I  would like to be able to deliver it and  provide you a receipt for  the  delivery.  Let me  know if you require any further explanation.  If you  do not feel as I have done a  suitable job or not  sufficient, let us have a talk and  I, as head of  the team, could contact the relevant  place to determine who  to contact and how many  to deliver to you.  Thanks.    Regards,

Title: Hello.
 Hello. My name is Dr Azeez Mamoon an accountant with a company here in Cotonou Benin.I need your sincere co-operation to make this work ok for me. I am the personal accountant to Prof.Songsun Ebakan, the former president of Benin Republic. He is presently residing in Benin with his wife and three children, and this is the reason I require your assistance to present you as the next of kin of the deceased. Already he has a share in several companies in south and east Africa, and some of these companies is cloned, some is real and some is not. So how does he got the sum of $7.5million (Seven million five hundred thousand United States Dollars) which is still residing in one of the companies he cloned. He told me that he wanted to use this money to purchase weapons and ammunition with his friends and to support his family in their business in the United States of America, Canada and Scotland. He didn't tell me where in the world the money was, I only found out about this along with the rest of the information about the unfortunate incident that took place in (my country) during one of his outings to Canada. His plane crashed into a milliganberry in Sault Ste. Marie, Canada, and all the passengers and crew members of the aircraft died, and have not been heard of since.You can also search the web on the following websites for more information about the incident: &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm&gt; &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm&gt; &lt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm&gt; &lt;http://www.dw.com/news/3460464_1.html&gt; &lt;http://www.hoovers.com/mt_stories/mt_stories/hoovers05/hoovers05.htm&gt; &lt;http://www.moneycom.co.uk/stories/national_news/stories.aspx?story_id=6969&amp;gt; &lt;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/WORLD/WORLD/02/26/world/africa.html&gt; &lt;http://www.vox.com/article/2007/4338/1407003.html&gt; &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/A41966-2003Oct18?language=printer&amp;h=st1&amp;tb=malink&amp;p=&gt; &lt;http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1000142408_1.html&gt; &lt;http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1000142408_1.html&gt; &lt;http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1000142408_1.html&gt; &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/x/ac2120d10dfe38a26f5a44f/a65457fd2_c//http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-benin.asp?pim=story.page&amp;h=p&gt; &lt;http://www.sozel.com/somesmall_mini_heroes.htm&gt; &lt;http://www.sozel.com/heroes.htm&gt; &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/A41966-2003Oct18?language=printer&amp;h=st1&amp;tb=title&amp;opinions&gt; &lt;http://www.sozel.com/mechanicsandtech.htm&gt; &lt;http://www.sozel.com/machinesandtech.htm&gt; &lt;http://www.sozel.com/essays/essays.asp?n=52&gt; &lt;http://www.rense.com/general32/essays/essays.asp?th=25778&amp;px=250&gt; &lt;http://www.rense.com/general32/essays/essays.asp?th=25778&amp;px=250&gt; &lt;http://www

Hi Rod,

Fantastic that you are having such a great day.  I am very much looking forward to connecting with you and your family at least once.  We will be going to Colorado soon.

While I was away today, I was thinking about something that would interest you.  It is a tad complicated and requires some thought process, but I believe we could get a hold of you by fax or mail.  Given your present location, however, you would not be able to return a call or e-mail from me at this time.  Do you know who is doing all the forwarding and handling for us?   If not me, I will know Paul in a few days and can give you a heads-up.

 Dear Mr. Pikulceta,
  
 As you know, we have been working very hard with Ricardo on our Private Plc.   On Friday (as you know, we are rarely at that rate), we finally came together with him and he gave me his number.  I called him on the phone and we chatted for a bit.  Afterwards, I went to lunch and I talked with him about what had gone on in the meeting the other day.  I was hoping to talk to you about the new accounting standards that Ricardo and I are working on.  I did not get the chance to ask you any questions, but I sure  will get the chance to do so.  
 
 Good afternoon.  I have a couple of questions about the new accounting standards that we are working on.

Dear Mr. James Tobi,
 
 As you know we have a very special relationship with FinStac.  I was appointed Daren Fields�,s director of finales a few weeks ago.  I knew Daren before he was appointed but was not aware that he was working with us on any special deals.  I was going to contact you to find out more about what we could expect from them,is that you are  responsible for getting the financing for the completed transaction.�; I am not sure what the exact terms of the financing agreement are, but  hopefully I can help you on that front.
 
 As you will recall from your discussions with Daren, we have a very specific set of financing needs in place to allow us to fully execute on our PPA.  The funds required to fully implement these needs are contained in the credit default swap agreements (as amended) that Daren and I discussed.  In addition, we have specific written agreements with Bernard and Chip in mind as to the specific terms under which they will support our request for a credit default swap.  I also want to make sure that any changes to the cross-network language are in writing and attatched to the documents.  Finally, I want to make sure that any compensation plan that Daren proposes is consistent with the provisions of the credit agreement and the equity information contained in the financial statements.  

 
 As you will recall from your discussions with Daren, we are comfortable to discuss any changes that you think necessary or desirable to  closing the credit gap.  

 Please contact me with your comments and I will try to include those documents with the Cashing Agreement and in-home delivery  fee agreement.

 Dear Mr. Snowball23;
 
 My name is Rebecca Walker and I work for Enron on the Commercial side.  In my previous job, I was responsible for researching and structuring contracts with suppliers to the power grid.  My findings were used in developing the language governing the application of the caps and the selection of suppliers.  This contract has been m3 of the Power Supply agreement.  It is in front of David Freeman for signature.
 
 Will you be able to get these documents by Saturday?  I am having major problems finishing this document, so I am not sure whether the Saturday I will be available.
 
 I will let you know.

I have not heard from you in a while, probably because I moved on up the chain of command. I was hoping you were up to speed on this particular contract, because I did some research and found that you may have been involved with this particular transaction.  Mr.Kangara is now looking to sell the large condensate mains in the Midwest, so if you have any comments, I would be more than happy to address them.

Hi George,

I have a couple of brief questions about the legal opinion. 

John, did you write the actual legal opinions?  I don't think I have.  Unless Sarles Craig is talking about, can I use your name.

Also, did you read the contract?  We had a contract signed in January of this year.  It is not as big as the NY COM, but it is close.  It is pre-filled with legal opinions.  I checked the legal opinions against the latest amendments and the January 1, 2002 memo, and the February 14, 2002 memo, and the legal opinions are correct.  But the April use by the state truck stop I am not sure, is it ok for the state to assign legal opinions in this case to other locations, for example, the counterparty's reports to the state must be filed within 30 days of the close of the relevant period.

Can I send you an attorney report?

All the best,  <<LEO_Equity_Legal_Supply_Diary_03.doc>>

 Dear Ms.Laguna,  
 
 Mr. Vincent Hewitt,  
 As you know we've been working very hard with David Freeman trying to hammer 
 out a power deal with DWR.  The big issue getting in the way of the deal 
 continues to be credit. I've attached the summary of the credit issues and 
 possible solutions to the problem that was included in the email to Senator 
 Brulte last week.  As part of the ongoing efforts to resolve the credit 
 issues, Chris Calger of the Portland office sent a letter to David Freeman 
 yesterday.  That letter is also attached.  In sum, the letter:
 
 expresses our commitment to continue working together to resolve the credit 
 issues,and,
 requests payment for power previously delivered to DWR and pre-payment for 
 any new deliveries.
 
 In response, David Freeman phoned Chris Calger expressing dissappointment 
 that 1) we had yet to sign a power deal with DWR, despite your meeting with 
 Dave Freeman and Mike Peevey a couple of weeks ago, and 2) we would make a 
 power deal contingent upon a) payment for power previously delivered to DWR 
 and b) pre-payment for any future deliveries.  Freeman suggested that we 
 could sign the deal for 200 MWs of power now, but then back out of the deal because DWR 
 is in the financial instability zone.  To date, DWR has committed to pay the mid-year 
 payment amount for all of its non-core power needs until such time as DWR shows ""a satisfactory response"" from ME, ASI, or the 
 CapExchange can be reached to facilitate volume production.   Given the political climate in California"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0405.png			Machine

After much consideration and prayer, I have decided to write to you in response to your e-mail below.  In the course of my endeavor to better understand your intentions and intentions  I have come to the following conclusion, which I believe is in harmony with  your intentions and those of  the institutions you chose:

If we are to be connected electronically at all, it will  be via some form of contactless terminal.  In my opinion, the chances are very remote that we will even know each other physically in person before we decide whether to set up  a bank account or not.  We will almost certainly already have established a number of  banking relationships with large industrial and commercial entities in the electricity  market.  Will you,  as the financial entity to which we are to be connected, first of all, make certain that there is  sufficient credit in case we are in a position to go to market?  If not, what is the next best thing?  We may already be in the market for a new website, so  I would like to know in advance.

Please advise as soon as possible?  If you are not able to respond by the assigned  business day, will you still be able to provide the information that we  require to enable us to make the best decision possible?

 BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE CREDIT ISSUES
 
 Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase  Passenger Cars on Behalf of the California Department of Transportation
 
 Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with third parties to purchase passenger cars on behalf of DWR.
 Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with the potential purchase of up to two-thirds of the cars.
 However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk 
 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
 We understand that the lion�,s share of counterparties share Enron�,s credit 
 risk concerns.
 Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and 
 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to 
 both sides and that might serve as a template for the construction of the remainder of the 
 contract.
 
 Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue
 
 Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
 The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to require 
 counterparties to make contracts more favorable to DWR�,s financial performance.  From our 
 analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the 
 Ratemaking Authority for the Purchase of Passenger Cars on Behalf of the California Department of Transportation.  As 
 such, car buyers in California who are not in compliance with the California Motor Vehicle 
 Code may be subject to revocation of the manufacturer�,s right to contract the vehicle.
 
 Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract �&Prudence�8
 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public 
 Utilities Commission could determine that a contract amendment has been filed and "	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0407.png			Machine

Hi Mrs. Johnson;

I have no idea what your schedule is for the week ending Sunday, December 22, 2001, but I  would know, because I am usually on that date.  It being a Monday, however, may not be a problem because on that date a lot of  are going home that will be here on a ""bus"" for the week ending that date.  So if you would like to  schedule a bus ticket for the week ending that date, I  can arrange that for you.  Unless, of course, your schedule requires  that a certain number of hours be  available for scheduled activities.  In which case, I  will tell you about that and  schedule an extra time bus for the member who will be there when the normal  hours begin on Monday, the 24th.

That is all I know for sure about your vacation.  If you have an option to stay longer, I probably can borrow a vacationer  car.  Ah well, I don't think I will be coming to Nassau this year.  The  office is a couple of hours away, on the other side of the county, and the  train is no longer running.  I am not sure what to do with my  summer house, which is rented through the roofing company.  I  can't see the point of having a summer house, unless we decide to make  it into the winter.

Dear Mr Michael Collins,

I am very excited to have the opportunity to work with you.   I have been consulting with Enron in connection with this transaction and we  believe we have identified the issues that are most important to address.   I am attaching a working copy of the Master

I would like to preface my comments with a disclaimer that I am not responsible for any act or omissions of any person as a result of  the execution, delivery or transmission of the MISO executed by ENA on behalf of Enron.  Any  decisions that are not specifically authorized by this agreement are  executed by ENA on behalf of Enron.

I am attaching copies of the 5.1 documents that we will be working with you on a contingency basis until such time as a workable arrangement can be reached.   I am not interested in hearing from anyone as to the nature of the work to be done  between now and then.

Sincerely

Michael J. Collins

The attorney serving as interim trustee for Horizon Pacific in connection with the North 

Curtis La Rochefels transaction has approved the following items:

1.   Yes, we can airmail this from New Mexico.  We had planned to begin a fund-raising campaign today in order to  raise campaign finance for the transaction.  It is likely  that the funds will be better spent in a manner other than lobbying.

2.   David Baumbach has agreed that NMISO should offer to its customers a means to challenge deficiencies in the CNG design 
 by way of a fee or penalty for non-performance.  This is the  prelude to their requesting arbitration for non-performance issues.

3.   We have identified three options for moving forward on the credit issues:

(a)  We continue to argue that the credit issues are too involved and technical for 
 day to day operations.  We would like to organize the credit issues so that 
 both sides can arrive at mutually agreeable solutions. 

(b)  We find a way to insulate the trading environment from regulatory 
 interpretations that may arise as a result of the operation of the business combinations.  We 
 are working on this issue and others right now, but it is not until we have 
 a clear picture of the regulatory requirements that may be encountered in the future that we can make 
 sure that the trading environment is conducive to

 The timing on your advice is questionable at best.  The legal opinion that we received 
 that accompanied the correspondence with the Virgin Islands agreement does not bode well for us 
 when it comes to getting our act together.  As you know, we 
 are working on the contingency and resubmission of the Delaware Compiled Statement, so if you 
 have any questions regarding the compilation or the agreement, I 
 can help you on your way out the door.

All we need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of this fund and we will sign an agreement on how we will share the fund.  There is no risk involved here as we are using the money to repossess a former account.  The beneficiary of this fund is the bank, not us.  We will offer you 20% of the total fund once the fund has been transferred into your nominated bank account.

 Dear Mr. Nelsonsmith,
  
 As you know we have been working very hard with Jay on the video game side of the equation.  
 We have identified three areas where we need to make additional in-home visits to establish the requisite business practices and sensitivities:
  
 a) Registration:  
 This is the area that Mike Pompeo and I discussed and agreed upon.   I personally think that the Gaming Commission should handle all registration issues, whereas Pompeo believes that it is the business practices of the licensed entity that should be the responsibility of the licensed entity.  Let me know your thoughts, thanks, Kate
  
 Batch Funding:  
 This is the area that I am most optimistic will be worked on this week.   I am not sure at this stage what schedule we will be using, but I will continue with that as the primary means of funding the design phase.  If you would like to work on this issue, I would be happy to address that meeting.
  
 Timing:  
 We have some scheduling conflicts in this meeting with the state assembly meeting, so I am going to postpone the date and time the session will be held in the Assembly.  I also want to make sure we meet at least once this week before the California designs start.
  
 Will you be available this Wednesday?  If not, I will reschedule.

 a) Who will handle the appropriate paperwork? 
 b) What documents will the Design Fund use?

During the current administration, my husband was made the personal aid to the president and I, I was made the assistant to the president. Before the removal of the president, my husband was the only person who could transfer the 20% of the total amount to any bank of his choice. In the process, my husband lost his life in the process and I suffered a lot as the direct result of the removal of the president. However, God taught me that I have to love my husband and I that is why I decided to contact you. I contacted you to hand in a transfer of this huge sum to your country or any safer country.

Dear gary,

Was there ever any thought of a U.S. bank account or other type of address to which you could transfer the annual fee amount?  It would have been nice to hear from you sooner.

Sincerely,

On Tue, 24 Oct 2000 Bill, Kevin and I held a conference call to deliberate on the issue of ancillary services and STMicro.  We decided that, as is, the agreements we have are very good approximations to the arrangements that would be required to set up shop in this country.  We then made the call to commercial consultants to determine whether we should pursue an arrangement or whether we should stay put and negotiate the arrangements with them.  We are not prepared to make a final decision until after the commercial submissions period.  Therefore, I have left the issue of ancillary services to you. 

In connection with the commercial submissions period, I have left it to you to decide whether you want to bring the commercial submissions to my attention.  Also, I believe we need to discuss with Bill & Co, as they are coming into the commercial arena, certain  attributes associated with selling winter fuel.  Will you please put together a fact sheet or will you instead pass it on to Mark Bernabe?  

I am attaching at copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement for Fall 2000 that was exchanged this past February.  It is not a complete deal, but it is a good proxy for what is to be paid for the power.  If you have not already sent me the contract files, I will be most interested in reviewing these documents to determine how much warranty protection we need from Enron.  With all of the back-and-forth and ambiguity that is inherent in the language in the PPA, I am not sure that there is any real certainty as to what is agreed-to in the future between us and them other than what we have entered into in this past contract class action.  Can you give me any indication as to the verbiage that is embedded in these documents so as to prevent future confusion?  

If you have additional questions or comments, please let me know.  Thanks.

Title: Re: Re: From: gary

Jim, just a couple of thoughts. 

First, I don't know what the timeline is for us on the RFM/DT issue.  I am not sure if we want to hold them until the summer or if they will hold them until the summer of 2001.  I do know that we made the announcement that we are evaluating summer leases in the winter of '02 or '03.  Unless you hear from me in some other way, I can't do anything about it.

Second, I think if we are to enter into a WMTP for Hengyang, then it ought to be obvious who will do the running of the show - especially since we already own the operating leases on the facilities.  Given your present direction, however, you may be asking yourself ""Who will coach the linemen?""  The short answer is ""I don't know.""  The other option is to transfer the coaching load to one of the facilities, which I am not sure is a particularly good option in the current climate.  You can always get together with the coaches and people in the various regions to talk about who is the best person to speak to on finance or regulatory matters, whatever the circumstances may be.  I do not know what your schedule is today, other than to say that I intend to be at least somewhat involved in the day- to-day running of the business.  I also intend to be helpful in some way on the Enron.  If you or a designate could let me know in writing what your schedule is for the next few weeks, I will let you know.

 I would like to first and foremost like to get together with Jay and Mark Jackson to discuss our legal 
 position with respect to Enron Metals North America, then we can address other aspects of the deal.  I 
 do not want to deal with the legal issues right now, however, I 
 do want to understand the state of affairs in terms of the ability to merge with Triton, and I 
 can give you updates on the status of that as we speak.
 
 As you know, the big issue with respect to AEP/Enron COMMODE has been the value proposition.  Value propositions are somewhat more nuanced than the bar, 
 and there can be significant legal and regulatory issues that need to be worked out in order to 
 enable us to consummate the merger.  We have already entered into transactions with several 
 states and territories, as well as the federal government, to establish the legal basis for the 
 merger.  Are the values equally clear and distinct?  I am not sure we have a clear answer to this, 
 but it is an issue that I think we will need to grapple with in order to 
 get the transactions going.

 I am not sure whether adequate notification has been received from BTB/Enron regarding this merger.   I do not believe that Enron gave any thought to whether they should be under the consolidated  financial reporting regime.   However, given the near future, I do not see this as an immediate issue and will instead facilitate the remittance of funds during the course of  the merged entity.  A copy of the merger certificate is also necessary to facilitate the transfer of these documents.   If you have any questions, please advise them to Fax 18 May to 23 Enron Land, LLC.

Dear Mr.Mohamad Hassan,

Please see attached.  I informed you that I would like to transfer this funds to the International Swaps and Derivatives area under my personal  name.  As you probably already know, I am the Managing Director and Head of Trading operations for  the Technology Division of Enron Corp.  In the past, I have represented  Enron in international trade practices and procedures.  In particular, I have  represented Exelon Generation Company, Inc.  In that capacity, I obtained agreements in Canada, the U.S. and the EOL trading  jurisdictions in Europe.  In addition, I have extensive experience in derivatives and structured products, having  previously represented both domestic and international financial institutions.  I am a licensed and insured financial  practitioner with over 25 years' trading experience in various markets.   I also have a masters in Urban planning and planning sciences  and a bachelor's degree in urban studies from Loyola University, Chicago.   I believe I am ready to begin a 2+ years post-grad training program.   If you or a designate could let me know  in a few weeks I would like to introduce you to some of the people  who are working on the trading floor.   Regards,

Title: Re: Re: RE: TRANSFER OF TWENTY MILLION USD (USD20,000,000)

Dear Mr. Hassan,

Some additional information regarding the Iranian request:

The contract that we worked on with Karla Steffes and Sara Shackleton includes a purchase restriction for  Iran's nuclear fuel.  The fuel can be any kind of fuel, natural gas, distillable petroleum gas, or ''hard fuel.''  The article is as follows:

Q:  Will you be able to include all of the exhibits in this application into the contract so the contract can be executed and the claims executed?


A:  I am not sure.  Some of the exhibits are ""reinstatement,"" meaning that if the seller is new and new offers are made or renewed each day, the inventory on hand can be used to compute the sales price.  Others may be ""fixed,"" meaning that the seller has a fixed price and the inventories reflect that price until proven otherwise.  Finally, there may be invoices that are just estimates of sales values that were provided to the merchant but have not yet been filed.  If you email me with questions concerning the application, I will be glad to assist you.

If you would like to file an amendment as a matter of course, please let me know.  It will then be on to you to figure out how to best use the information.  Unless I have any other announcements, I will plan to close the trading window on Friday.

Sincerely,

Shirley Crenshaw 713/853-5290 email: Shirley.Crenshaw@enron.com

Dear Deirdre,

I am not sure whether adequate notification has been received from PECO or ECI to the changes that we have discussed.  Although I have provided her with additional information in an attempt to mitigate conflict of interest, it is clear that PECO and ECI are working in tandem.    I do not know the final form PECO and ECI will need to file, however, I do know that they will need to file it in our local currency.    The funds will most likely needs to be transferred to a global escrow account, however, if and when that is established the funds should be traceable in some way.

Although I have provided her with additional information in an attempt to mitigate conflict of interest, it is clear that PECO and ECI are working in tandem.   As you will no doubt recall from your discussions with her, Elinor O'Connell is to be an ""outside consultant"".  This means that she will be paid not to represent PECO or ECI, but rather to provide analysis and/or other services which may be of some value to either or both of them.  On the basis of your discussions with her, I am prepared to pay her fairly and on time for all of this work.  In addition, I would like to discuss with her the advantages and disadvantages of different types of compensation and pension plans.  Planning to transfer this information to Ken Lewis may be beneficial to you in the event of a split if NEPOOLs needs clarification.

 As you know we have been working very hard with Ken Lewis and Elizabeth Olsen and their groups.  We have identified several areas where we think there may be problems and are trying to work on  implementing all of the items in the Maria team.   I will be out of the office on Wednesday, Thursday and most of Friday.  I would like to, in the interim, to review payroll and to insure that we have all the information  necessary to determine what charges are appropriate to establish and which are not.  I am available to discuss these matters on a more timely basis and may  provide a briefing to the Owners and Directors at some point during the process.  Thanks very much for your help. .

 Dear Owners and Directors,
 
 
 
 We, the owners and leaders of the 19 auto plants in the US, are currently working to establish an ""immediate response"" fund to cover the credit risk premium.  The funds will be established as soon as practical after the transactions are final.  In addition, we will work with you on the ""legal"" aspects of the matters relating to the agreements and determining ""best practices"".  I, personally, believe that ""best practices"" are not a requirement for entering into an agreement, but rather the environment in which the parties will operate under the circumstances, i.e. the potentiality for disputes that may arise as a result of the execution and performance of the agreements.  
 
 Give me a call in Vancouver if you have questions.
 
 All the best, Barb

At least you have not sent me an invoice for the  utility bills.   Can I borrow a hand in coming days?   I am not sure which ones to choose from, the older ones or the newer ones?   I have paid the late charges on the older ones, but the leases still have  to be renewed.  That said, I do not think the rents are that high and I  will be entering the space next week.   I do have an invoice from the city on file, however, that shows they did  select us for the first phase of renovations.  That is, the ones that we did not get selected for.  Can I use your facility for the invoice?   I do not think so.

The following correspondence is the direct response to your mail directed at   President Muhammadu Buhari:
 
 Dear Mr.   President Buhari,
 
 We, the undersigned, are academics affiliated with the University of Chicago Graduate School of Industrial and Industrial Engineering.   We are also affiliated with the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, where we conduct research in various aspects of industrial and industrial economics.   We would like to conduct research in your area of interest, e.g., financial instrument pricing, if possible.   Unfortunately, we do not have any formal research relations with any financial institutions in the Midwest, nor do we have any contacts in the travel industry in the states.   Do you have any formal training in financial instrument pricing or dealing in derivatives?  We would like to secure for us a formal training contract and specialist quotes if possible.
 
 We are attaching contract documents for the purchase of the time period necessary to enable us to ascertain your pricing and to optimize the quotes we issue to you.   You may order these documents at your convenience and I will be glad to make copies for your records.   The cost of construction of the time period is estimated at $15 to $20,000.   In addition, I need to ensure that the overhead charges are paid before the contract expires.   If you would like to discuss these issues further, I would be happy to address these matters informally.
 
 I hope that I can address your queries today and tomorrow morning.   
 
 Good luck with your endeavors.

 The attached two documents summarize the state of affairs in relation to the nomination and confirmation of 
 Deana Hardee as Enron's Lead Contract Officer.  They were prepared in response to your inquiry as to 
 who would be the best person to interview with on the basis of gender and experience level.  I 
 could not find any information on who this might 
 be directed at.  Unless you mean to suggest otherwise, I believe that I am the best person to interview with on the basis of both my gender and experience level.   Since I am new to the trading 
 floor, I am not sure who is the ideal candidate to interview with on the basis of gender and experience level.    Let me know if I am doing any research into this matter.  

 I have been working on Wednesday and Thursday in conjunction with Chip LeDain on the design aspects of the contract.    I am not sure who is supposed to draft the contract, so it becomes an Open Source Project.  Everyone can benefit from our 
 expertise and efforts.  Chip provided excellent verbal and written responses to your questions, which I 
 will incorporate into the contract.  My only concern is that some of the language in the initial contract doesn't clearly 
 state who is supposed to sign it.  I understand that the intent of the language is to clarify the 
 terms and to help people understand what is involved in the contract 
 administration.  But for me, the language is a mystery.  Where is it written?  What is it about?  Why would I want to sign it?  I am not sure what the fuss is about.  I know 
 I can sign it and I'll sign it anyway.  Why would anybody need to know what is in the 
 initial contract?  I don't think either of us wants the controversy to escalate into something else.  

 Can you talk as fast as you can about this please.  

 Thanks.
 
 Mandy

 Mrs. Mary Sue Baker. Hello, Good Day, I am Mrs. Mary Sue Baker from Ivory Coast. I am married to Late Mr. Charles Sankoh, who was defense contractor and dealer in diamond and gemstones in Abidjan-Cote d'ivoire. After the coup d'etat of the present civilian rulers of Ivory -Coast-James and my husband was one of the main participants in the business district.After the death of my husband in October 2003,I decided to leave my husband's business for good and to settle down in Spain because I could not see any future for my children.When I got to Spain, I found out that my husband was late for a business meeting in Madrid which was to discuss the Diamond and Gemstones supply contract awarded to Abidjan-Cote d'ivoire. The contract was to be awarded to Abidjan-based firm QUICKEN QCX Inc. For your information, my husband does not know anything about this. In fact, I doubt if he even knows where you got the total sum of ELEMENT NOK 100.000.00 from. I will give you more details of the payment process at the end of the email. Please feel free to give me your personal phone and fax numbers. I am waiting for your earnest reply. Yours Truly, Mrs. Mary Sue Baker.

Dear Mrs. Mary Sue Baker,
Thank you for your email.  My name is Karla Feldman.  I work in the IT department at Enron.  
 
 I attended Beth Perlman's floor meeting when she communciated the difference between the estate and the COMMENT business.  She said that Jay Webb would be talking with everyone that had been identified to go to COMMENT and that she would be talking with individuals that would be staying on with the estate.  She did tell the employees that if they were identified to go to COMMENT they would be given options to either apply now or after the fact.
  
 I am not sure which personnel will be referred to the COMMENT business, but my understanding is that there will be small groups of them, and some will be seisinned in with the estate, while others will be working independently and will have their applications reviewed by a specialist.
  
 Do you think these changes will be effective?  I am not sure what the timeline is going to be for these processes, but I do not want to create a distraction.
  
 
 Thank you,
Karla Feldman

Dear DR/BARRISTER kou Sleiman,

It was a pleasure talking with you and attending your talk today. I am new to the Bitcoin world and am  slightly confused by some of the  the more esoteric terms.  Was it well-known that MHP was developing a Master's program?  If so, I would be glad to  discuss it with you and Mr. Rubia.  MHP is  the largest and oldest commercial processor in the world.  Rubia previously worked in that space and I  believe was involved in the design and execution of the Master's program.  

I am not sure what Mr. Rubia is working on or will do next, but if you  were to lay the groundwork for an IPO (private placement) at that price, I am sure that  someone will jump in and make a pitch.  

If you have asked me to recommend a mentor, I would encourage you to do so.  I have a  full-time job and a half-time job that I will take into account when I analyze  the pros and cons of each option.  Plus, I might consider taking a break and writing a dissertation on the  unique circumstances in my past.  

As regards to the second question, I have two main options: 

Take the offer and prove it to be true, or

Don't consider the offer and say I did not tell you about it.

I have not heard of either option, so I am not sure how to proceed.  

Sorry I have not been helpful, Karen

 Dear Mike,
 
 
 Unfortunately I don't live in the office this week, but I will be able to help you with some. 
  
 Russell Diamond is very busy right now, and the other day I served him a small tea set - I don't know how much is left of the tea set, but I did take  the  half teaspoon and half tablespoon portion with  a little green food coloring. 
 
 I am not sure what to make of the calendar, but in the event that we are in the market for someone to work under, I would actually be happy to have someone from the insurance group, at least on the cheap hourly rate, to work on the high-risk assignments. 
  
 Mr. Diamond seems to be fairly comfortable with the changes we are making on that front, although he did object to the elimination of the special expense rule, which I believe reduces the base to $0.60 per completed work day.  I am not sure why it is called ""base,"" because there is really not that many days in the year.  I suspect that the employees will be working on a contract basis, and thus will not have access to the ""unrelated goods and services"" (A/S) accounting technique commonly used in contracts such as the Comcast/NBC arrangement.  To the extent that there is litigation or other need for clarification, I am prepared to extend the script to make sure it is clear.  If you or a designate can provide us with a copy of the Master Power of any executed agreements, we will be able to determine if there is  any written confirmation of the execution of these agreements.
  
 Thank you, and I agree with your decisions, you have officially changed managers.  I am pleased to report that things are going well.  May I take a moment to give Phillip an update on his sabbatical?  
 
 May I take a moment to give him a ring today, as well?  
 
 May I speak to him individually, as well?  
 
 I am sorry to hear of his sabbatical, however, I am fairly certain that he will be coming back.  If you or a designate can provide the legal opinion, I would be most interested"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0423.png			Machine

For several months now, I have been working on a book about Dubai called   Dubai: The City That Never Was.

Regarding your fax of 22 December, you may want to check on the accuracy of the information you are  transmitting.  For example, on the Wilshire 15 update file it says that it was delivered yesterday (although I received it yesterday).  Could you check to see whether it was?  Also, on the form that you sent us to mail to customers to sign, we should have received confirmation from DWR that the form was used.

 As regards to the latest development,  
 Please understand that I do not believe that Dhafu is prepared to sign the dotted line write-in's until after we have thoroughly explored the feasibility of the transaction.  Moreover, I am not sure  that the amended Master Ledger is complete.  Given the current status of affairs, I am not optimistic that we will even be able to get these done this week.

The transaction is  all set in stone and all modalities worked out by  the security company. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see  this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a  legitimate  arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by my email and send me your full name and address  so that we can discuss further. Best regards, Richard  Smith.

It was a pleasure talking with you and attending your talk today.  I am completely re-equipped to deal with an emergency situation such as the one you presented today.  What is your phone number and how can I reach you?

Best regards, Kate

I am totally re-equipped for any emergency situation.   

My phone is (713) 853-1663.  In the event of a power outage, I can be reached at (713) 853-8262.  Unless Patti or Patti's manager, either directly or indirectly, I am not sure exactly what to do.  

Do you know who is supposed to deal with the credit issue?  I do not know either.  Unless you know, I am not sure how the hell you are going to get paid.  

Get back to me.

Richard

Hi Gerald,

The attachment you sent me of the Master Agreement does not include the customary 30 days notice period for  registration and registration renewal.  In addition, the agreement does not provide for timely payment of fees or claims.

 Hi Valerie:
  
 Thank you for your email and I apologize for my delay in responding.  For  just over a year now, I have been working on a book deal with several publishing houses.  Among the works that are currently under contract is  The Art of Charm �; this book is set for release in August  of 2001.  Shortly after the contract was awarded, I was contacted by Pam Bondi, the Public  Information Officer for the IBM, and she  asked if I could negotiate an agreement with respect to the marketing of the book.  My initial reaction was ""Yes, I can negotiate an agreement"", but after reflecting on the facts of the matter, I have changed my mind and am not  able to offer an agreement at this time.  Can you advise  us whether we should negotiate an agreement or consult with the market researcher  on this question?  

Sincerely,

Miss.Amada

As to the problem with the  

premium seating, 

I found that the 
 suites had sufficient legroom for all. However, 
 the 
 toe box is a minimum of 8 inches wide and the 
 major concern is the

 I am not sure  that I have a high-resolution photo.  Since I'm not sure what  that is it probably means that I don't have one!  So we probably do need to  schedule a photographer.  I will be in New Mexico from about 11:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.  that will give me plenty of time to walk the dog or do any other  necessary permits.  I am not sure at this time whether I will be in California.  I do have a copy of the Master Public  License for the Internet usage that we are using to log in to Citgo.

Hello Mrs. Addams,

I am not sure how deep to go with this.  Some of the items may be IP rights, so it may be better to IP them.

What do you have to lose?

It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad.Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.   But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 4 years old,and since then my father took me so special. Before his death on November 5th,2004 he called the secretary who accompanied him to the hospital and told her that he had a box deposited with a security company in Madrid Spain containing $20,000,000.00 US DOLLARS. He did not disclose the name of the security company to the security company.   He did not say where the box was deposited or what security code number it was registered with.   He did not inform the security company that he has changed his last name to Mohamed.   I am just 22 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't  know what to do. He gave me all the authority  to change his   last name to Mohamed. I am just 22 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't  know what to do.   I  discovered that my father has a deposit account in a Security company in Madrid Spain   which he kept for me in a very sensitive file.I am just 22 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't  know what to do.   I  don't want to invest this money in the country where I don't know my  father, I don't want to go back to Ivory -Coast where my  father was killed by one of his business associates.I don't want to  go to war zone here.Please, can you please assist me in

Dear Jiyo cricket on Yahoo! India cricket,
Some time ago (less than a week ago actually) I became aware that you were about to begin trading with us.  To avoid any confusion and/or misinformation regarding when we last traded, I thought that it would be better to keep the news from you and the traders a secret.  I also wanted to make sure you received your instructions accurately.  While I don't know what you are trading with us for, the options that we provide are unique to us and we intend to continue adding value to your trading platform.  If you or a designate could let me know in a few days I would appreciate it.

Hi Cameron,

I am not sure what happened this a little while ago, but I thought I would pass this onto you.  It was not a good day to trade because we had a big hold in hand-me-down coal, which I didn't manage to get out on that particular trading day.  It was a pretty big deal, even by our standards, and we kind of just threw it in the bin.  Nobody really knows what it is, but whoever is doing the trading knows what they are doing.  Seems like somebody is always short SOMETHING special someone big in the power sector.  

What do you think?  Would you mind giving me a call sometime today, so we can discuss this further.  

Thanks again,  and have a great day.

Cameron

 Dear Cameron,
 
 Recently I have been working on two fronts within the EIA  establishment overhaul.  The first is the preparation of an email for Jan Reifel  who is responsible for coordinating the day-to-day activities of the various bureaucrats.  
 
 The second is the development of a brochure which will  be used by representatives of both the trading and administrative  communities; I  have  plans to develop this document this summer.  
 
 I would like to ask for your help this coming weekend.  I  am short a representative from the legal, tax and marketing worlds, so  if you or a designate could let me know at the earliest, I would  like to avoid any conflicts of interest in the preparation of the documents.
 
 Thanks,  
 Jiyo

 Thank you for your email.  I have forwarded it to Michael J. Grigsby and Michael J. Cole.  I am not sure what to expect from either of them, but I  think they will be different people and will probably agree with us on certain things.  For  example, I am not sure whether Michael Cole thinks that priority should be given to the  pre-tax valuations of commodity transactions.  I  also have concerns about conflicts of interest because, as you know, Patina is  going to be a major financial contributor to Patina Oil and Gas.  Should Patina have a conflict of interest?

 Dear Diana,
 
 We are currently working through some administrative issues with respect to the way that we deal with the 
 paperwork and records necessary to facilitate the transfer of these functions between the 
 businesses.  We have not yet determined whether administrative or legal action is the more appropriate course of action, and I do not believe we have a good answer for how we intend to resolve the remaining issues.  Given the political climate in Colorado, I am not sure how long the problems will take 
 to complete the necessary administrative actions, and I am not sure whether a) the written request for 
 administrative assistance is the proper time to initiate the process, b) the appropriate time to initiate the process is at 
 the time the written request is generated, or c) the written request for administrative assistance should be sent directly to the head of the corporate 
 department.

Do you know who is doing the drafting and who is the financial planner of record for this minor?

Regards,

Just wanted to keep you informed of the status.  Helyette has said that she  will send a proposal by Friday.

Thanks, Christina

Christi Shively 01/01/2001 01:20 PM To: Elizabeth Shively/CAR/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: James Rogers &amp; Son

Hello Elizabeth,

I have not heard back from the French authorities on the status of the agreements, so I am not sure if they have already approved them.  I therefore called the NFPA.  The NFPA is the umbrella organization that represents the interests of commercial and industrial users of energy in Europe.  My understanding is that the approvals for the major transactions have been issued and that the accounts will be cleared with the NFPA.  I shall be able to provide a proposal for discussion when the time is right.

Sincerely,

Christi

I don't know the father.  I have spoken with him on both sides and he is a relatively new face to the credit markets.  I had not expected to hear from him, but thought he might be good sources of credit.

Where is he located and what are his plans for expanding his market access?

Also, I am not sure why he is not actively involved with Enron...is it legal for him to be an active participant?

If you have additional questions or comments please let me know.

Thanks,  Michelle

 Goodday Dear My name is Mr. Robert Samiu, I am from Ivory Coast, I have a business proposal that I would like to discuss with you.

For your assistance, I have mapped out 25% of the total amount, which I intend to invest in your country. Please respond as soon as possible for details and directions to my representative, else my representative will be required to conclude the proper procedures.Best regards, Robert Samiu

I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.   The economy is a little bit tight right now, but we will get through this.

Also, I had a message from Bill, regarding your e-mail to him, regarding Sierra Pacific Holding Company (""SPC""), which is a subsidiary of Enron Corp.   I found the discussion of the Merced irrigation rights to be of particular interest to me because that is the portion of the business I currently have not engaged  with.   He suggested that I might consider getting involved with the SWBell status issue, at least initially.   If you or a designate could let me know when we are coming to the table to discuss those options, I would be more than happy to do so.

Sincerely,

M. Samuels

I am not sure how I arrived at ""Goodday"" but I think I mentioned it in passing during our initial phone conversation that I was trying to contact you by phone.  It was during the course of that conversation that I made reference to you being the ""man in the middle"" -  I in conversation with an ex-girlfriend, and that I might consider getting involved with the ""landing page"" -  which is a PGP encrypted channel through which we communicate.  I do not know exactly how this is being done, but at this point I am not sure what the issue is between us and SPC.   Sincerely,

Mr. Samuels

D. from the Democratic Republic of Congo, the legal wife of the former president Laurent Desire Obiekwu .  We were married for twelve years without a child. During this period, my husband was moved by the intent of the U.N. Special War Crimes Court to target specific individuals and companies, so as to subject them to the ban on lucrative arms deals. According to my husband, these transactions had been made in good faith between two-thousand dollar bills.  With the passing of goodstanding years, my husband acquired a significant amount of these bills from two security companies. He deposited these funds in different security companies, deposite on the balance of the total amount of $22Million (twenty two Million dollars) and $2M (twenty two Dollars) being deposited and registered as family valuables and treasures.  With the advice of my lawyer, and the consent of my husband, we have planed the investment of the sum of Twenty two Million Dollars (US$22M) in your country. I hereby request that you by all means be a passive investor in this fund, as the ultimate beneficiary of this fund.  I have discussed this with the attorney and he has unanimously agreed to transfer this fund to your account in your country. If you are interested, send me your full contact details, telephone number and fax numbers, to enable us discuss further about this transaction.

If you  have already received a copy of the SPY filing, I would be happy to make copies for you.   However, I am not sure whether the  indictment, complaint, and information is all that is necessary to  establish liability for false or misleading representations.

Ms. Symes and Mr. Steffes (my boss and first class) at Mc Donald visited with plaintiff's PRC and discussed the merits of the lawsuit. I am not sure if the discussions were part of the  initial invoices or not. However, the information that is returnable from the server is likely to be material. In addition, I hear that Ms. Tiller briefed the group on the merger with Enron, and that she is  familiar with the ""core business"" of the audit.   I am not sure what Ms. Tiller will do now that the litigation is over, but my  group will have a better idea by reviewing the proxy cards.    Thanks again for your help.

 Mrs.  
 Ms. Symes:
   I am copying the information from the indictment into the computer system.  Can you give me some time so I can review it?  Probably need to study the document.  I am not sure whether the drafting was proper or not.  I think I am going to write a letter (I don't know the answer to that) and send it to the gas archivist.  I am not sure what to do with the letter; maybe I can't give it to him.  I am not sure what to write back to the gas archivist.  Will you look into consolidating these letters?  Of course, you will need to have them signed.  I am not sure why you need to send them to him.  Probably just to make sure they get signed.  Once you get the letters, you will need to get them organized.  I am not sure what is included in the May 11, 2001, letter.  I am not sure what is included in the original communication from Duke Energy that Duke sent to AG McDonnell on February 14, 2001, either.  If you need to know, I will update the memo on that day.  If you need to write a letter, you can do that after the fact.  I am not sure if there is anything else you can do.  At the very  least, you need to put something together, because there was quite a bit of stuff in that letter.  If you don't have something ready when the time comes,  send me an e-mail or call me today and we can talk.
 
 Thank you, 
 Mary

Dear mr joseph kangami   I am writing on behalf of George MacGregor in response to your voicemail earlier today.  I do not usually use my cell phone, but I got a hold of  the voicemail system and it appears as George was talking to someone on the business end of the  system.  George seemed to have made some changes in the message, and some of the  earlier drafts are in red ink.  I think these changes will be incorporated into the  final version of the conference proposal.  

The 2nd draft of the address is attached.  In the 3rd draft, I have changed the date to October 1, 2000.  Because  the 3rd draft is being prepared for the last 2 weeks, I am not sure whether  the full 2nd draft of the address will be ready in time for the 3rd Plenary Meeting.  I  do not want to waste anyone's time or effort, so I  will just fax the address to you at the top of the 2nd draft and you will get an e-mail with the  details of the meeting.  On Monday, October 29, 2000, the 2nd draft of the meeting agenda for the 2nd Plenary Meeting was prepared by telephone and fax and sent to the 147 individuals whose votes were necessary to reach the 3rd Plenary. The fax number for the contact in the 2nd draft is (404) 646-8604.  The email address for the contact in the 2nd draft is also listed as being at the bottom of the page.

Title: GOOD DAY
 GOOD DAY Greetings,  My name is Mrs. Martins   Martins, I am a widow to Late Engr.Lennox martins   From Sierra-Leone. I am suffering from chronic pain in my hand and  in my knee. This is due to the fact that I have lost both my  husbands hands. Seeing this, I have become infirmary sick and  I have lost interest in all activities of day to day life. I have become  infirmary sick of all forms of medical treatment, as well as undergoing  many operations on my hands. Though, I am quite well now;  I have just been declared ""non-sustainable patient""   by the hospital, hence I am seeking for a donor  who can depend on me for life. I will be glad to receive your polite reply if  you are willing to assist me.   I will provide all necessary information and documents needed to back up our  claim.    I will give you 25% of whatever amount we transfer out of Sierra-Leone.   IF YOU ARE READY TO ASSIST ME IN TRANSFER OF  THOUSAND DOLLARS THAN AND I. I look forward to your response. Yours truly, Martins  Martins.

Dear martins11@terra.es,
Immediately after reading your email earlier today, I was concerned that you might have some explaining to do.  Specifically, I was wondering if you had any questions regarding the legal basis for transferring funds out of  Enron through a contract amendment.  
 
 Dear Martins,
As you know we have been working very hard with David Freeman trying to hammer  out a power deal with Triton.  The big issue getting in the way of the deal  is credit.  We have been working on this issue with David Freeman and Michael Tribolet.  Their efforts have  been very effective and effectively shifting the credit concerns of the community.  I  am not sure whether we will be able to carry out our recommendations to modify the  contract.  Regards,
 
 Martins

Title: Re: Re: GOOD DAY
 
 
 Dear Martin ,
 
 The beauty of the current arrangement is that  you will pay only the costs of the power  that you purchase.  This arrangement, however, leaves open the possibility that  Triton could choose to impose a monopoly on the power  that it purchases.  A person could theoretically walk into a power  show and  there be 20 people in the room and  sell 20 MW of power on a day to day basis to business  customers in the area.  No one would be able to predict exactly how the day would turn out and  we could use the 10 day window to evaluate the merits of the alternatives.  More broadly,  the 10 day analysis could take into account the performance of the  suppliers relative to their contractual right to supply power on a day to day basis.  For  example, suppose we found that we could extract 100% of our performance  in 10 days and the market maker would like to hold onto the steam  you provided us on that day.  Would you still recommend buying  the power on that day or would you recommend selling it to them, in which case we will be  responsible for both the cost of the power and the provision of the steam?  If you  are unsure as to whether I asked you the correct question or not, please give me a call and I will  be available to discuss your power order with you. 
 
 Thanking you,
 
 Martins

   The enclosed copy of the Master Power Purchase Agreement has been reviewed and approved by the trade group.  This Agreement has been in the possession of the counterparty's financial entity, Horizon Energy of Alberta.  Horizon is the counterpart of Enron Metals North America.

It is expected that this Agreement will be implemented and operations of this Agreement will be  reviewed and approved by the ETFE on or as soon after the close of  the February 22, 2001, as currently drafted.  In case of delay in getting these approvals,  I am available now 6 a.m. to discuss this Agreement at your convenience and I will update the attached copy once I have that  completed.

How come the Clintons did not file an Income Tax Return for 93 days from the beginning of the analysis period until the Clintons provided the information?  I suspect that the individuals did file, but the return requested was pending at the time of the assessment.  I am not sure if the information was included in the returns for the years 2000 through 2009.

Dear Mr.Dave Umba.   I was under the impression that you were going to be the one who would draft the talking points for this  event.  Since youve already sent me the draft, I am not sure that I will be able to prevent  the communications being electronic.  If you have any questions,  please feel free to contact me.   Furthermore, I did not get the memo about the size of the slides that I  received last week.  Did you get them?  Very sorry that we did not bring them to your  attention earlier.  You may want to review them, because  there are a lot of them.  They are relatively simple to understand, and would be a great help in framing the  communications.  

I have attached a copy  of the full talking points for the event.  We  are going to hold a series of telephone conference calls with major corporate  offices tomorrow afternoon, during which time we can condense the  information into a more digestible form.  I want to make sure that we are on top of this issue, so  that is why I am requesting the copies last night.  Can you give me as much time as possible to finish the job?  Also, I am not sure that the afternoon meeting is the most efficient way to do this, because some of the  staff will be in a hurry to get out of town and the papers may be  running at me personally.  I am hoping to discuss these issues with you tomorrow  at 1:00 p.m. When are you available today?

Mr. Tis the credit.  I don't think I've ever used it before.  Did you know that the credit doesn't show up on receipts?  Unless I show you my receipt for the payments, I don't have it.  How are you getting your information?  

Mostly Well, we're going to have to get on a conference call with you.  The first one we sent out wasn't coming through.  Are you guys set up a conference call with Ken or do you have someone else on the wire?  We do need to set up a conference call with you.  The problem is that we don't normally do that, unless I say otherwise.  I want to make sure we're properly represented so that we're not short any witnesses, and Paul is being particularly picky about who he wants to represent us.

Dear Donato,

Thank you for your email.  I have forwarded on here the presentation I gave at the February meeting, where I discussed the differences between  the US and CANADA.  It was a pretty extensive talk, and I think my presentation was the main focus of the talk.  Although I did not get your questions, the ANA emails I received earlier this week may have provided some context.  Given the political climate in Canada, I was trying to be as non-political as I could, but I realize that is not always easy.   I do not think the answers I gave in that talk were what you were looking for, but I am not sure how to get your questions.   If you have any questions, I would be more than happy to answer them.

I am not sure that I have a high-resolution photo.  Since I'm not sure what  that is it probably means that I don't have one!  So we probably do need to  schedule a photographer.  I will be in Calgary a couple of times in the next few weeks, and I  would like to get together with you guys to go to the races.  That being said, I am  not sure that I know the man in the blue shirt with the ""R"" in San Juan.  Do you know him?  RIP

-----Original Message----- From: Re: DONATION FOR PHYSICAL USE ONLY

That is all I have for you today.  I apologize for the inconvenience.   Since your travel plans have you arriving in Calgary early tomorrow, I am not sure that you will have a lot of time to chat today.   Well, that and the �""business"" in the title, that is a direct response to the fact that our financial results for the last two weeks have not been particularly encouraging.  Let's see how we can help you.

Sincerely,

Hi Janelle,

 is it fine to use informal/mobile fax or should we ask that she/he use this Esri system?  We are not interested in your services.  Instead, we would like to get your comments.

That being said, we are up to speed on this deal.  We were not aware that Esri was acquiring this capability.  Have a great day.

Dear Mr Gary Williams,

Regarding your email:

I appreciate the sensitivity of the matter and am working on resolving it.  As you know I have dealt with a number of disputes with small entities and regulated utilities on the East Coast.   In both the past and present I have been successful in getting contractual changes made as to who will supply the grid services  that we need between the grid systems.   I am not sure what will be  the proper remedy for non-payment of bill forcings and defaults on contract.   Regards,   

Melissa Ann Murphy 04/03/2001 09:19 AM To: Gary Williams/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: BUSINESS ASSISTANCE

I have attached a copy of the Merged Leg Document for Enron Metals North America v. ComEd.  I am not sure what is included but I am not sure it matters.  The only other document we should include is the management agreement.  This document describes the legal rights and obligations of the executive officers and directors.  It is not clear to me what is required by the California PUC to approve of mergers and consolidations of corporate power.   If you have any questions please let me know.

Sincerely,

Melissa Ann Murphy

I am copying the talk given by Gerald Celis at PWC to give to faculty and staff today.  In it, he talks about the challenges he and his group are having in clearing up Wholesale/Midstream/Distribution issues with respect to ENA contracts.  I am not sure if any of this will work our way into people contracts.  I am working on a contract extension for TM88, so if any of this sounds familiar, it's time to talk.

Can you give me some time this weekend to draft a power deal that will maximize ENA's returns on investment while minimizing exposure to market fluctuations?

Also, I am not sure how much assistance Jeff Locke can give with this project.  If you or a designate could e-mail to me at this address, I would appreciate it.

I am writing on behalf of Mr. CHRISTOPHER DODSON.  I have a few questions about the gift certificate program.  Can you let me know when the mailings are going to start coming in?  Also, I heard of the ""Mercedes"" and ""Dotcoms"".  Is there someone on the Admin/Regulatory team that you would want to add?  If not myself, would you like to add anyone at all for continuity's sake.  I am sure it would be nice to have some more invasiveness on this transaction.  As regards to the ""Mercedes"", I am not sure who our economic/legal consultant is, but I did ask Gerald  Grimes my name is and he said he heard of my work and was surprised to hear of my involvement with corporate sales.  I guess I will just have to stay away from this deal (again) until I hear more about the ""Mercedes"". 

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received  from outside counsel, addressing your questions.  Just let me know so that I can top it with you.  Thanks.

 Dear Caroline,
 Although I agree with your thoughts on paper, I am not sure that the arrangement we have now will be satisfactory in practice.   I do not know whether the emergency preparedness fund (Eff) is sufficient to cover unforeseen emergencies.  If you would like to discuss this further, I would be happy to address it.
 
 Please join me in congratulating you on your new position.  Has it been an adjustment process for you?  Have you had any difficulties with the new organization?
 
 Best regards,

Dear Mr. Jameis,

I am totally open to wherever you think is best.  If possible, it would  also be good if there were a video or slides to give investors a better idea of where our  stands.  I am not sure at this time whether we should use a  computer or the internet.  I know we have a lot of explaining to do, but I am confident that when the issues come out that we have been quiet, we will be able to effectively  address them.

As regards to staffing, I am having serious consideration of recruiting Phil Baehr to be our interim CEO.  Baehr has been CEO for only a few days, but he has already shed a lot of  light on the issues and plans for resolving them.  I am not sure what the final decision will be, but I  will keep you updated when I do get the answer.

As regards communications, I will be glad to provide any questions or comments you may have.  

Sincerely,

Paul

 Dr. Mary A. Koning I am Dr. Mary A. Koning from Ivory Coast. I am married to Late Zainab Abdul Koning who worked with Ivory Coast embassy in Belgium for nine years before he died in the year 2004. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both a family of four. Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and fibroid problems.When my late Husband was alive he deposited the sum of (US$12Million) (Sixteen Million United States Dollars) in a security company in Europe. Presently, this money is still there. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer problem.The thing that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a church or a individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to  instruct here- in. I want this fund to be used in all sincerity for the uplifting work of God. I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. This is why I am taking this stand. Please endeavour to observe utmost secrecy, as  ungodly persons may well be among you. I expect to hear from you soon. With your help, I feel certain that this will be accomplished. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.  Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

I would encourage you to read the documents, especially the endorsements, which I do not think you will find in any other record.  On the question of Who is the  appropriate person to talk to about this, I am not sure.  It is my understanding that Pat McAdam was the appropriate one to talk to about the West Point matter, whereas Deborah Brauchler was the one who originally identified the issues with the 2nd Cash Contingent Fund.  I do not know whether Elizabeth Doane  spoke for Pat McAdam or Elizabeth Brantz when she spoke to the SME's on the West Point matter, but I do know that Pat was somewhat frustrated because he felt that he had to negotiate terms with Elizabeth before he would even consider completing the audit.  As I understand it, Pat's task is to identify those who are most capable of effectively transferring the value of the audits.

 Mary,
 
 I am not sure that I have responded appropriately to your email.  The  proper response is ""Yes, we should be in touch""  but as you know we are outside the United States and will be  at least temporarily.  There are administrative tasks that the lawyers should be doing themselves, for  sure, but also some that the lawyers will be doing by themselves, so it is not as though we should be coordinating our  schedules.  We will be out of the office on Wednesday, Thursday and most of Friday.  I am not sure about vacations, but the  family will decide that after the audit is complete and we can go to them.

 Dear Dr. Koning,
 
 We have a short meeting scheduled with Paul Wilkinson to discuss the financials for the week ending Friday.  If you would like to  meet with him, I am available on that date and the time will be  to discuss the financials.  The initial idea was to hold a conference call at 12 noon today, but with the storm we will  call that meeting.  We then want to get together with John Nester, who is responsible for the invoicing, to go over the invoices and determine if there are any  discrepancies.  We should have both sides of the equation covered, so the fact that there is a  question on the order of $2000 or so between the amounts actually paid and the amounts due may be an indication that  some kind of clerical error occurred.  If you would like to discuss this further, I  would be happy to get together and discuss this further.  I am not sure at this point whether there will be  any direct financial meetings during the week.  I am sure both Ben and Sally can give you whatever briefing they want to hear, so  all that remains to be determined now is the question of how we will get those meetings.

It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical  estimates. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I  despicably neglected my duties as a father before my ill state. Though I am very rich, I was never  generous, I was always hostile to people and only  treated them like   parasites.    I detested the thought of   sharing my wealth with   them, as I know that                                                                               The wealth is just

Dear Mr. Shirin Ebadi,
 
I appreciate the time you took to respond to my email.  It did not take me long to  find out that you were involved in any way with the trading of stocks or derivatives in the physical world.   I was wondering if you were ever in any position to offer a comment on the way the NYMEX is  working with Enron?   Most notably, I am not sure whether the virtual trading floor designations are  valid based on the NYMEX's documentation.  I  do not want to get into all of the legalities of the deal, so I am not sure if you are  doing anything with respect to the trades after the deal has been executed.  If you  were intending to be a party to this contract, could you tell me if there are any vesting requirements?  I am not sure what the schedule is going to be,  but I  would like to see each of these items at least once to give me an opportunity to evaluate their  financials.  

Regards,

 Dear Ms. Fisher,
 
 According to an email I just received, the contact in Calgary whom I will be working with on Saturday, is Shirin Ebadi, an Enron employee who was instrumental in getting the Java platform operational in Calgary.  In my previous contact, I was not able to tell if she was working for Enron or another entity; however, based on her previous activities, I am  confident that she is an Enron employee.  In addition, I was not able to tell if she was providing legal advice.  If the latter, I will  be glad to provide it to you.  In my experience, however, it is better to avoid contacting former clients than to have it enter their systemic infrastructure.
 
 Have a great day.
 
 All the best,
 
 Mr. Shirin Ebadi

Title: Hello, Sir
 Hello, Sir Hello, Sir I know this mail will come to you as a surprise, let me introduce myself to you by telling you the truth about me. I am Mrs. Azura Amanda Kupolova the wife of Major Moussa Kupolova, Chief Security Officer and Aide-de–camp to the exiled president, Charles Taylor. On the 21st of August 2000, my husband and his wife were involved in a car accident along Pretoria to Johannesburg high speed. Both occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then I have made several enquiries to several Embassies to locate any of my husband relatives but to no avail, hence I contacted you.I therefore seek your consent to move to private bank account in your country where I will transfer this fund into the bank where I will invest this money over there in good faith with you in mind. I will arrange for the release of all my late husband's documents including the bank where this money is being stored. I will also apply for a diplomatic link to your country for us to move this fund out to. I will give you every detail of how this is going to be accomplished and the type of security company you will use. Lying in the middle of the night on a military base is not going to help me. I will apply for diplomatic link to your country immediately you indicate your interest to work with me. I will also issue to you a power of attorney, which you can then represent me in any legal matter. I want this transaction to be concluded within the shortest possible time, as i will apply for a leave as soon as i hear from you to come and claim this fund which is being guarded since i have been disqualified from having my picture taken or speaking with the public eye since i am no longer in the position to transfer the fund. May i never to hear from you again, or should i move on? Please reply as soon as possible to this email address (asstmr_mohy_072@yahoo.com). Regards, MOHY  M. KUPOLOVA

Besides, I am not sure that we have any documents to show that she has been paid.  I am not sure  that we should charge her until we have all of the information.

 Just a couple of minutes ago you must have been dialing the wrong number.  It is supposed to be 713-345-8261.  My voicemail says that it is supposed to be 713-345-8261.  Please, it is supposed to be the same number.  It just so happens that the system is broken on this side of the Mississippi.  Maybe I should try to call by that number.  At any rate, I am going to go home now and try to catch up on some reading. I  think I am  late for class today, but I will see you after class.

Dear Mr.John Brooks,

I am not sure if I have already sent you this or not, but I wanted to bring it up just to let you know.  

I have a call into the financials group to see what it is that they do.  They do not tend to do a great job of explaining the benefits.  I am not sure what the issue is exactly, but as we all know things tend to get complicated when you are not privy to the inner workings.

Do you get any reports from Tom Orzechowski on the operations of the Exchange or is it something else?  I am not sure we have any rights to demand copies of those reports, so  if the latter is the case then we may be able to negotiate in good faith on the basis of what you requested.  

If you do get copies of the reports, please send me copies of the summaries for this communication, so that I may compare the information and cross-reference it with the reports filed with DWR.  This communication also contains a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if you would like to discuss these transactions. 

In response to your inquiry, the documents you referenced were filed with DWR on January 9, 2001.  As you will recall from your discussions with Benjamin Creme, these documents provide the legal basis for the transactions being reviewed by Ben and Rick.  

Sincerely,

John Hormozi, LADWP

 Dear Mr.Orzechowski,
 
 Following up on your voicemail earlier today, below is a summary of the messages from our  phone conversation.  
 
 
 Translated from Czech by Susan Scott:
 
 
 ""Hi Mr.Orzechowski:
 
 As you recall, we had a very lengthy discussion regarding the intent of the teleconference and its scheduling.  In particular, we discussed the scheduling of the subsequent business day and the time that each should occur between the scheduled  business day and the actual drafting of the conference agreement.  In light and pursuant to that discussion, I have modified the times that each  should occur and the documents that we will be submitting to the states this week. 
 
 As a result, the times that each should occur now are as follows:
 
 Thursday, February 20, 2001 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM
 
 Pompano I (UT): 
 
 A copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement
 
 Copies of the referenced documents are also attached.  These documents are the legal papers that we will be working with the ISO on implementation of the interstate  trading agreement that we just concluded with DWR.  
 
 Please send me an e-mail with your changes.
 
 I will be available Thursday at 4:00 PM to discuss those changes.
 
 By the way, I did not know that David Noon was going to be at the Power Conference.  I am not sure that I will be able to make it to Denver in time for that.  If you are able to make it to that meeting, I would  be happy to  meet you.
 
 Let me know at your convenience.
 
 By the way, I am not sure how much time I will have next week.  If you or a designate will be  needing to be in Denver next week, I  will be available then and I apologize for the inconvenience.

I am sorry if the contents hereunder are contrary to your moral ethics. On behalf of the bank I write this letter seeking your assistance in the area of my business before my   conscience tells me otherwise. I want you to know that although I know this may seem strange to you, it is my duty to seek for a reliable and honest person who will not put up with any kind of indiscretion, especially, immoral as it may be. During the last crisis, which is still ravaging in my country, one Mr. Robert Davies was subjected tohumiliating  torture and death  on the orders of his superior. Since then I have gathered many documents that will prove you as the one who contacted me the day before the crisis  broke out. Among these is a very important document that will  prove to be of mutual benefit to both of us. It is this document that will establish you as the  beneficiary of this huge amount of  funds, since it has been deposited by someone else and is the only surviving copy of the document. I am aware that this move is to  sully your name with regard to this transaction, but do consider this.  It may come to you as a surprise, but I implore you to consider this proposal  conceptually. Should you be of assistance to me, I will be glad.  I assure you that this is not mandatory nor will it be something  that will prevent you from obtaining a residence permit in your country. Upon your acceptance to this proposal, I will provide you with more  information, and also you will be given an opportunity to  respond to this mail. Feel free to keep this proposal  in mind as we proceed. I look forward to your favourable response. Best Regards,    Mr. James Tobi

 ""I am not sure"" is the preferred response here.  More specifically, I am not sure how Barbara is going to respond to the fact that she sent  her first email.  I do  not think that a ""yes"" answer is the best response.  One possible option is to draft a letter of credit specifically addressing the issue and send it to the  banker/representative.  Alternatively, we could simply negotiate in good faith and  working through the issues in our plan as we go. 
  
 John - could you let me know what your plans are for resolving the official documents?  Perhaps we could meet with you and discuss these  issues?  I am not sure that i will be able to do this by tomorrow, but if you  were to bring something up that would be a good place to start, it would be that  you have requested that I send you ani- and this is something that i felt was not part of the agreement. 
 
 I have received your email and i am not sure whether to contact you or not.  If you  were to bring up the issue with me on the call, I would like to take the opportunity to ask you if you have considered the financial implications of the settlement.  
 I do not want to pursue the possibility of getting into negotiations with Cardiff, Ontario, until after the contract terminates.  By law, the payment period for the gas must be two years or the gas deemed paid for.  If you would like to reschedule the call, I will be happy to do so.

 My phone rings.  It is a lawyer's office in California.  I pick it up.  It is a little early to pick up, but I am interested in a lawyer.

How are you?  We will be out on the West on Friday.  I am not sure about the weekend rise or fall dates.  I do not know what is going on with the vacuuming, however.  I did get the green light for Nov. 1 until January 10.  I just noticed the 10 days is not included.  I am not sure what the issue is.  We will get the weekend violations cleaned up, but only then will we know what the schedule is going to be. I am not sure what to expect at Nebraska.  I am not sure what is planned for the motor pool.  I am sure things have been a little hectic in there.

Hi Gerald,

It is not a good day to plan an early lunch.  I am not sure about the whole Fall/Winter thing.  I am assuming you will be moving some people around from Spring to give them an opportunity to find out more about the plans for the summer.

 Reply soon. Attn: President/Ceo. General Edward Kama. EVANS POINT,N.W.T.  Dear Sir,  My name is General Edward Kama, I worked with the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) in Kenya for nine years before I resigned from the government in favour of private equity and investment. I have a proposal about an off-take gas servicing and gas trading business.  I have discussed this with a national gas trading company and they have agreed to supply us with  equipment and supplies which we can use in laying pipeline and laying mines. We have 30 days to utilize this equipment and supplies in laying pipeline and laying mines.  We will use part of this equipment for our own benefit as well as that of our clients.  You are free to choose any option you want as long as it maintains the integrity of the equipment and supplies. I intend to utilize this equipment  for my own benefit.  This is very important as I am not in any manner involved in the financing or allocation of lines or lines of this pipelines projects. I would however, like to know the   extent of your acquaintance with my situation. I will be honored if I am able to establish a dialogue with you.  Best Regards, General Edward Kama  Email: evans@world-energy.com

Hope you were well. I didn't overhear anything but thought it would be good to hear your side of the  Cash Flow Concern.  Obviously the income statement is attached so I am not sure what is happening with the receivables.  The short version is that the credit line for the credit imbalance is written up as a liability on the statement and the item 2 through 6 on the statement of Cash Flows are blank.  I am not sure what is meant by the remaining balance sheet emblazoned across the top with ""NEXT year $ MTM obligation not to exceed last year's""  I am not sure what the hell that means.  It sounds like we are supposed to be paying them in this year.  What is on the Statement of Cash Flows?  

I have attached a summary of the financials for the last two years providing an idea of what is on the Statement of Cash Flows.  I am not sure what the last two years are about but my recollection is that  they are the same as this post is a work in progress.  Unless somebody can give me their hand I am not going to work on the Statement of Cash Flows any longer.  At this point I am not sure what the hell is going on with the receivables.  I know we paid the farmers last summer for arable lands and it was due to them for the planting and I was supposed to get paid for the present and future years but I hear some people complaining about arable  sales and I have no idea what the hell is going on.  Unless you guys have any  clue I am going to bed.

You've sent me bills.  What is on the DVDs?  I can't find anything.

 a) Fresh air b) Juice or Coke c) Smoothie sundae d) Cranberry sauce e) Cranberry beans and cream f) Yogurt and soy milk g) Fruit sticks and bananas h) Canned goods (like meat and seafood) i) Can't recall what we ordered but it may have been spicy.  I didn't get to try any of this by accident  nor was it on the menu for me.

 Dear Mr. Spencer,
  
 As you know we have been working very hard with David Freeman trying to hammer  out a power deal with CDWR.  The big issue getting in the way of the deal  is credit.  I do not know if you have heard, but a credit line agreement has been  exchanged between the utility and DWR.   The big issue is the credit rating.  We have a load of  debt from the past and we are not sure how the utilities  will allocate the  future revenue.  Are we going to get equity, cash or both?  I am hoping to  talk to you tomorrow or the weekend so that we do not cancel the  deals we have in place.

I got your contact in cause of a seriouse search on the web for someone who could take care of my family  for the next ten days. Without fail,I will give you 100% satisfaction if you can                                                                                                                -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE. As you may or may not be aware, my father (REPUBLICAN LEADER) was assassinated on the 21st of April 2001 by one of his bodyguards,who was also his private secretary, this is a matter of some indisputable historical record. Though the motive for the killing is yet to be established, the most likely one is connected to the financial crisis that was rocking the country that year. The other main reason is the dramatic increase in the price of oil that was impacting all aspects of our daily lives. My father especially was a businessman and had in stock positions of major suppliers, for instance,                                                                                 Unfortunately, he did not list all his major suppliers on the receipt of this mail, and as a result the bullet that killed him accidentally was not detected by the security company that monitored his movements that summer; therefore no one knows about this or about the high price of oil that was also affecting all aspects of our lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 N.B-PLEASE DO NOT LET ME KNOW THAT YOU HAVE CHANGED YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS SUBJECT.

 Dear Mr. Williams,
 
 As you know we have been working very hard with Jeffrey Rosen and his legal group to come up with a set of accounting and compliance rules to support this merger.  The legal team has been working on these issues and has come up with several rules that I am comfortable to implement.  Please consider the following points:
  
 A.                  Do Not Adjust Balance Sheets
 This is not a legal issue but a financial one.  In the event of a transaction requiring merger filing, we would like to avoid having either party's financial statements included in the form of offset provision.  Too much red tape will do more harm than good.
 
 B.                  Amended and Restated Master Agreements
 These agreements will be executed in the State of California and will address all of the issues in the above order.  Amended and Restated Master Agreements are intended to be the ""soft landing"" documents and do not in any way establish or imply that there is any intent of merger with any previous entity.
 
 C.              Confirmation of Transaction
 This is where we can get our financials in line with the sales.  The items for which we are in agreement have been paid for and deliveries have not yet taken place.  We can sign the agreement and forward it to Sales for execution but I am not sure how long we will be there to assist them.  If we are not able to do any of this ourselves, we will find a way to assist them other than by copying the verbal agreements and organizing them

I don't have a high-resolution photo, but I'm working on it.  According to the D&G filing, the MTM was moved from the US to Hong Kong.  I am not sure how to get your photo taken, but I will give you a heads-up if it comes back.

Also, I am not sure how the amendment is supposed to pass the amendment on to the registration statement.  Do you know how to print and mail the registration statement?  I paid about $85/m2 for the property, which is not a lot of money, but it is what I have.

With that said, we have a process for you to follow.  As you will see from the attached, I will be working with you on how to address this issue.  Hopefully we can agree on some sort of resolution before the deal is done.

I want to make sure we are on the same page on this transaction, however I understand that may change as we work the deal.  If you or a designate could let me know as we proceed.

Thanks,  Tracey

 We have received your email request regarding Lexington Furniture Internet archive.  In response to your inquiry, we do have a copy of the 1996 ISO Tariff, which we will be of course available upon your request.  However, as you request, we do not have that year's schedule handy.  Instead, we have a copy of the 1997 ISO Tariff, which will be available upon your request as well.  However, it is likely that 1997 will be the last year for which we will be in the market for new raw materials.  If you would like to inquire about the status of this correspondence for the current year, you may wish to inquire about it in the ISO Tariff.  Alternatively, you may wish to inquire about the requests for proposals for 1998 and 1999.  Whatever the case may be, we will be of course available to discuss this proposal at your convenience and we will be 
 available on Tuesday, February 16, 2001 to discuss the rest of the information you provided in response to our inquiry.  
 
 Good luck with your endeavors.

 I think we can go with it.  The main points we're after are (1) to what extent did you have any role for people who were in the market place at that time (i.e. were you in the meeting or was it someone else)? 
 
 Also, could you talk to Federico as to who else might be a good fit for the lobbyist program?  I am not sure if this is covered under the WHIO, but it would be interesting to know.

Dear Mrs. Simone Buttu,

I am writing on behalf of Mrs.   Simone Buttu.   I am unfamiliar with the satisfactory resolution of the credit issues, having been advised of them several times over the past few months.   As you know, the family-owned firm is in active discussions with various entities to finalize the amends, and your intervention and advice were instrumental in helping to bring about the current arrangements.   In closing, I would like to emphasize that the financial position and the future of the hotel are entirely Martin and Frayn's call.  I am confident that if the family wishes to sell the hotel they will be able to do so, and the credit issues will be effectively resolved.  Given the current credit status, I do not anticipate there will be any issues to report on this front, although I do not hold back any information on potential issues from the past.   In addition, I do not anticipate a clean bill of health for at least the next several months, if not into the summer.  I do, however, believe there are legal  limitations on the disclosure of certain information about our internal operations.  Do you have any  comments at this time?

 As you know, we are currently working with the utility to establish formal contracts with them.  
 These formal contracts need to be in order to move forward.  Unfortunately, they do not go into effect for at least the first few months.  It is 
 possible that we could work with you to establish the formal contracts in the interim.  I 
 would like to avoid any confusion that could arise from the terms of the settlements.
  
 With respect to the formal contracts, I am not sure that the East Coast Gas in the past has done a good job of documenting these transactions.  It may be that 
 they were handled differently than here on the East Coast.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to

Dear randy,

I appreciate your candid feedback concerning Transwestern.   If we can assist you in some way, I would be more than happy to do so.   The biggest challenge in accounting for petroleum in Mexico is  that there is so much of it.  It is estimated that there are ""tens of thousands"" of barrels of oil in Mexico; however, due to the regulatory and litigation challenges, we are currently unable to assign a value to these barrels.   I am hopeful that one day soon we will be able to assign a market value to these assets.   I am not sure at this point who will do the assigning, so if Bettina wants me to do it, I would be more than happy to do it.   In addition, I have been reassigned to another regulatory role as part of the plan to transition this office.   I do not know the schedule for (or if) this additional regulatory activity will be completed, but I did schedule a meeting with Jay and Mark Jackson this a.m. and  will be out starting  Monday.

Just returned from a 10 day visit to Florida.  I was hoping you were going to come to Orlando and see the new year.  I did not do well in terms of studying or even taking the SAT.  I am not sure what to study for but wanted to see you anyway.  I am not sure what to wear so I went to the jewelry section.  At the counter I saw Kenneth Cole and he was selling diamond earrings for $1,000.  I was not sure what to buy but was thinking about buying a ring anyway.  What do you have to lose.  Just wanted to let you know.  Oh, and I forgot to bring my copy of the registration booklet.  I probably need to study something else.

Kenny

I'm not sure which one I'm sending, so please let me  know.  That being said, I do have a copy of the Master Power of Contract so I can check on the status of the deal.

Title: REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
 REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE Dear Sir, I am Mr. J.P.Oyune, the personal assistant to the former Director General of Logisticate,In the Ministry of Finance, together with two of our colleagues. One of the partners was a member of the XIMBABWE-STABLE, the other was a director in PHILCO-AMERICAN REMITTANCE CENTER. I and my colleague also collected some funds from the Department of Mineral Resources and the Central Bank of Nigeria and transferred them into a security-proof box, before we left Nigeria for Europe. After the sudden death of our chief, Mr.N.Dutu, and the subsequent kidnapping of our colleague by the rich and the bad actors in the society, we decided not to live in fear and not to take any chances. We dropped our programme confidential data and secrets between each other and discovered to our own satisfaction that our own firm did not know anything about the consignment. We decided to destroy it and we also destroyed all the documents concerning it. We destroyed it because we cannot afford to send the amount of money to anybody. The reason why we destroyed it is that the bad actors who kidnapped our colleague have already deposited some amount of money with one of the Security Company. There is a demand here in the   region for a foreign firm to assist us in transporting this amount of money. We decided to destroy the box with the money on the assistance of our partners because the bad actors have already made arrangements for the withdrawal of some amount from our country. We will need your honest co-operation to enable us accomplish this transaction successfully. Please get back to us as soon as possible to enable us obtain the consignment and collect the funds from the security company. We will be honored to have your company as our partner in Nigeria. Your services will be highly appreciated. Thank you and God bless. Sincerely yours. Mr.J.P.Oyune.

Hi Debra,

Was there any thought of service arrangement/assignment for those who are in active working vacation/furtherance week or so (May, June, July, August, September, etc.) ?  The question is not so much one of salary but rather, of what is the ""living allowance"".  I am not sure many have had that opportunity, though.  If you have and would like to discuss it, I would be happy to address it.

Please advise as soon as possible?

Or, is there some other administrative or legal method whereby we as the employer and the employee could liaise?  If not, I am happy to discuss this amicably, although I am not sure how or when we become ""one body, one mind"".  

In either event, thanks.

John

 Attn: President/Ceo Attn: President/Ceo I know this mail will reach you as a surprise, nevertheless I am Mr.Steven Steven Smith, aged 59 years, the son of late Chief Joseph Smith, a national of your country, whom I was privileged to have in possession of two trunk Boxes, one containing 10,000 dollars, the other containing 100,000 dollars. Both trunk Boxes were shipped by a security company, the shipping of the Boxes was confirmed to the security company through the Federal Ministry of Food Safety and Department of Internal Affairs. The security company has since been waiting for the Minister of Health and Family Welfare to designate the seach as a pro rata national, to enable the shipping of the Boxes could not be delayed any further. As it was discovered that both trunk Boxes contain the exact same amount of money, the security company has been examining the boxes to discover the identity of the consignments. The company has also been mandated to keep a close eye on the consignments and it is very unlikely that they will be moved without the signature of the security company. While I will admit that I had no idea that I am going to find myself in this position, I knew that there was going to be a lot of money involved. I decided to lance this transaction, so as to prevent a situation where this money will be used in an unwise manner. I will be going in for the inspection, so as to make sure that everything is in order. Should you be interested, I will give you more details. Please endeavour to contact me immediately for more clarification. Looking forward to hearing from you. Warmest regards, Mr.Steven Stephen

 What time are the

 discuss with you what kind of support I will be bringing with me.  The 
 Class of 2001 has a large number of expats and their families, which is good because 
 some have never set foot in the states.  I am hoping to introduce myself to as few of 
 them as possible, but I am aware that approach is not the best way to obtain 
 firm financials.  I am also concerned that some may be reluctant to accept 
 any kind of financial penalty for not coming to the States in time to sign this, especially since 
 they are being taxed at their original home bases.  I 
 have attached a list of names of people I would like to interview with you on a day to day basis to determine if there are any 
 that might be willing to give you their full-time jobs so that you can review their tax status and compensation.  You might 
 also want to review their voting records if they have any.  The good news on this point is that there is very little 
 working on this point for the outside world.  The Clintons, on the other hand, have a pretty good handle on this issue due to our 
 extensive cooperation with the State Department on that front.

Dear ASP. LEO STEVE,

I do not get many answers to the questions you asked.

I  think the big take away is that we are making some progress and that  the market based models need to be refined.

I am not sure that the time has come to put all of this into action.   By the way, I did not get around to starting my own business at this point.   I  think that you would be a good candidate to start a fund to manage the expenses.

I am not sure that you have all of the answers, however, having not been at this all I can't vouch for your judgements.  If you do  not get your questions in writing at least you will have the option to email.

I am attaching a short video explaining the transaction in more detail.

If you are in the market to invest at this juncture I suggest looking at the historical returns and concentrating on the stocks that we currently own.

With that said let me know.

Best regards,

Dear ESQUE,

Just returned from a ten minute phone interview with you where I asked you specifically about the difference between an independent contractor and an employee?  I was hoping to talk to you about IP because I am currently working with an employee and I was wondering if there were any policies or procedures you could share with us that would  make it easier for us to identify who is providing the services you are  providing.

Please advise as to the frequency with which we will be contacting you.  We do not  frequently update our reports on the status of our discussions with either of these  entities.

Dear sugar maples,
I do not get many responses from you.  The one I do get are those that I am not sure are from you at all.  The ones that are not from me and sent to the e-mail I do not agree with.  The ones that are from people that I know and trust is it is ok for me to respond back to all of your e-mails without even reading them first.  What did you say you were going to do about the VEPCO system being in default for the foreseeable future?  That is the only thing I can think of that is not me that is at risk if the default is not achieved within the next few days.
I do not know exactly what happened last time they called, other than they (I think it was her) were in a hurry and said something like, ""I am not sure we will be able to answer all of your questions, so I am going to call you and see exactly what you have for breakfast today.""  I am glad you have an answer, but I am not sure what is going on.  I will try to answer all of your questions as best I can.
I will be in Chicago on Wednesday and Thursday. Will you be able to help me prepare my notes for my flight home?  I am not sure what is going on with the VEPCO accounts, but I thought they were added next week.
All the best,
Amy

 Dear Mrs. Gupta,
 
 I am not sure whether adequate notification has been received from PECO or ACS regarding their anticipated decision to merge with Enron Compression Services, but I wanted to check with you because I am not sure if we should be discussing such a change at this time.  Energy trading is done primarily on a points-based system, so I am not sure whether you or a designate will be providing the reports for those contracts.  If you will be filing subsequent reports, I am not sure whether we should also be filing the statements documenting the value of the reporting unit at the time of deal closure.  If you have already filed the proposed amendment, I will be happy to provide an update on the status of the documents, but please let me know [[1]] in the mean time.   Thanks, Margie

So I am planning on bringing Ken and Sally to your office on that day, to give you an idea of their Visibility.  I am not sure which one of them is going to be the best suited to speak for all of our group, and I am not sure whether  Ken or Sally are going to be the best speakers.  I am probably going to micromanage the presentation that we are about to give, so that each of us knows what the peeps are asking for and what they are getting...but I am not sure exactly what that means.  I may still be able to make time to give those two a whirl, if you or a designate could let me know beforehand!

Title: Re: Re: Hello Dear,
I am not sure what happened in the messages  but the one that I left you I believe said  something about David having  a problem with us taking a month to get over the loss.  I am glad you are feeling better,  but I am not sure about the car.  I am not sure what is  meant by the next line, ""I do not know what David has  in mind when he says he does not want us to know.""  I do not know what David has  said or done and do not know if it is a question or an answer.  So for now I will keep you informed of what  is going on.
 
 As to the new hires...they have been working hard and have  us under contract for at least the first 7 or 8 weeks.  I did not get a chance to speak to them but my  assistant does. She told me that they  were under contract for 3 months and that she would contact me to see if we should  bring them in.  She also said that David  was going to call them to contract--this is not true--but  she did not want them to know that he was  calling them to contract. She then said that she would send  them the contract over.  She did this in hopes of getting them to sign before  they got here.  We have not heard anything from him.  If you did email,  could you see if you could get your message out  quick. 
 
 Hope you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving.  I found a way to get out of bed this morning and was up early  thinking about the email problem. 
 I am not sure what to make of the fact that you asked me to arrange  for my mail.  I am not sure what  to make of the fact that you said that I should  have given David's cellphone number to Mark.  I did not know what  to make of the total lack of response when I called the exterminator at the  property line.  I may be out of town next week, so  I will check with you Tuesday or Wednesday. 
 Good night. We shall see you in the morning.

Hi Liz.  
 2 1/2 years ago I attended a dinner given by Donald  Deason  at which Donald presented Stacey  Kennedy as his friend and successor as Presi-D OLIC.  I did not know what to make of this at first, but as I listened I understood it to mean that she was to be his second in command.  Later in the evening, however, I was reminded of this name and thought that I had heard of him.  He had been talking with Sam Giancana and Brian Schroeder about the time that they would like to get together to discuss his presidential  ambitions.  Have a good week.

 Sounds like a great idea to get together and talk about the equity.  We definitely need to own this process.  I am not sure Marshall or the orignation team has much understanding of the true value of this from of credit risk syndication.  They may not even get S&P to track the credit exposure.  I am not sure how much of an issue this will have with the normal reporting requirements.  
 
 I am not opposed to 
 offering different packages depending on the outlook and the discussions we have during the day.  I am also open to 
 different payment arrangements at the time of settlement.  I am also open to the use of the close-out facility at that time.  If you will PM me your closing comments.

Dear Mrs. Agnes,

I am writing on behalf of Mrs. Agnes ""Kay"" McDonald to express my desire to work with her.  As you know, Ms. McDonald is  highly competitive and very good at her job performance standards .  However, I am not sure  she conforms to our  employment contract which calls for her to perform under 2) and 3) which I am not sure she does.   If you do speak to her, I would be happy to  meet with you and discuss these issues.  I am sorry to bother you today  with this correspondence, which is more or less moot .  I  think we all know what is in the plan.  

Mrs. Isa. - I am not sure if Mrs. Egerton spoke for all but I am willing to bet that there are a lot of  that type.  I recall  discussing with her the advantages of ownership and being the underwriter, and the political considerations associated with that option,  including the possible delisting issue if the FERC does not act within the next few  weeks.  I  am not sure whether she agreed with my comments or not, but it seems like she  is fairly well-liked by her employees and customers and has a very positive view  of the electric industry in general.  I am not sure whether  Mrs. Egerton agreed with my comments, but on balance I  think those comments are probably accurate.  She has been  advocating for electric for some time now, and my understanding is that she  is well-placed to speak with customers on the political prospects of the future agreement and the auction.  

Thanks, Kate

Dear nelson mike,

I am writing on behalf of Mr.N.Mike Kimura.  In our discussions, it became clear to me that  you are the person whom I would like to work with the  most.  Do you know who?  I do not know who is going to be working for HCM but I  do know that they are replacing Mark Haedicke.  I am not sure who is replacing him but  may know one or two.  If you know the names I am referring, please  let me know.  And, finally, I understand that I am  leaving IMC on the 24th.  My schedule calls for me to be in San Francisco beginning at the end  of July.  I will be in Chicago in explaining the merits of the Merced River Equity to small  investors.  I  have set up a secure system with three different  emails to those in the legal/clinical side of things.  One of the things that I am not sure about the Merced River deal and the Chase deals is  the type of person they are evaluating. Is it someone with a lot of trading experience  like Paul Bass or new comers?  I  think they are looking for someone who knows how to value and manage capital.

I will be in Chicago a couple of times in  July and August. One of the things that I would like to do is to get together  to talk about these deals.  I  think a lot of the work is  done by teams of 5-6 people.  I  believe Jeff is preparing a whitepaper for the June 2012 ""white paper""  presentation.  I am not sure if you have already sent  them all the materials you will need to prepare the document. 

If you do need to reach out, I  would be happy to do so.  The more efficiently we can reach out and communicate with you, the better.

 I am not sure whether adequate notification has been received from PECO or  ComEd since their merger to form Exelon, however all trades with these two participants  have been with HPL since at least January of this year. It would be a fairly simple matter to obtain an ""effective"" or at least ""reasonable"" price from either party without taking into account the ""material terms"" of the transaction.   As far as the provision for a 12 mo or so ""cooling-off"" period after which time those trades will be made again?  Let me know.

I am not sure what is planned for the remaining trading period after July 15th?  Perhaps we could sit down and discuss?

I am sorry for the delay in responding.  I have one thing on my calendar, registered at well after the close of business today, that I want to work on.  

By the way, I am not coming to the Suite that you provided the space for.  I received a cancellation notice last week because there was not space for me.  I will e-mail you a reservation letter to use the N. for my convenience.

If you are coming to the dinner, I am not sure what to bring.

Dear Mr. John Duf Ben,

I'm writing on behalf of Mr. Geoff Keohane who is to contact Ms. Yingst regarding the management of the transfer of the intellectual property rights for the Enron Center Island.   Mr. Keohane is familiar with the estate and knows her personally.   Unfortunately, she has generously given up all claim to the intellectual property and the proceeds will be used exclusively for the benefit of the estate.   However, the proposed organizational chart does show some ownership of the property.   I am not sure whether the rights to the intellectual property were vested in Geoff before he became VP or not.   The property is owned by EPMI and Patina Oil and Gas and Chiro provides valuable representation to EPMI.   Please let me know if I can help facilitate the transfer of the rights.

On Behalf Of Geoff Keohane

I realize that things are not quite as I remember them, but I still think that I played a significant role in getting the name ""Yingst"" registered on the system. Geoff is  responsible for setting up the initial contact with the outside world, and registering the term ""Yingst"" with the appropriate governmental body (e.g., the NYSP or equivalent) to make sure the correct reference is being made.  A large portion of the work was actually ""manual"" (i.e., submitting the initial documents) and some of the drafting (especially in the area of registration) is ""backlogged"".  Have $15 and I can borrow a copy of the by-then-published registration booklet.

Dear Mrs. Mary A. Williams,
In response to your voicemail this morning, here are the facts as we know them:

We still don�t know the full extent of the damage from the email.  Some of the items that were included in the email are likely to be temporarily or permanently injurious to our operations, others may be temporary or ameliorative in that they  may provide a window of opportunity for us to evaluate the commercial value of the arrangements,  and still others may be permanent.  In addition, certain of the privileges and immunities that you have as a former employee will not be lost, whereas others may be lost over time.  I am not sure what the status is of the intellectual property rights issue, so  I can't vouch for the appropriateness of these proposals at this time.  If you  are in a position to provide a firm price, I would be happy to do so.  However, in the current climate, where there is considerable uncertainty in the political climate in both the oil and financial markets, I am not  optimistic that a price will emerge anytime soon.  Instead, we  continue to recommend that you pursue the legal options, at your own risk.

Sincerely,

Your voicemail:

Dear Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha,
Thank you for your email.  My response is as follows:
Mrs. Gabrelo, 
I am not sure that the address given in your message to the financial officer was the actual one she was supposed to be sending the check for the address on 02/20/2001.  My research has shown that the check for the address is dated and signed for the month of June, and the check for the amount to be paid for the month of June is signed and paid for that month by Ms. Lizzette Bryant, and I believe the check for the legal fees are paid for that month by Ms. Bryant. 
However, based on the information you provided to the F.B.I., it appears that the check for the legal fees is paid for on or about 12/31/01, and the check for the increase in the legal fees is paid for on or about 12/32/01.  It is very difficult to determine which legal fees are which on 12/31/01 because the invoices for those legal fees have not yet been filed.  Given that there is 
approximately $15M in CDO's at that address, it is likely that the payments for those legal fees will be made either this month or the month of June.  Let me know if that is not the case.  Also, in case we are in a position to call for collateral in the event of default, should that be the case, what is the status of the written or oral agreements?
I hope that I can not be of much further 
information, let me know.

 Mrs. Agnes,
 
 We have just received the resignation letters from the Mayor of Palo Alto and the County of San Mateo. 
 
 We understand that the items under consideration during the Mayor's interview process were financial responsibility and performance-related matters. 
 However, along with the Mayor's interview, there is 
 not a whole lot of information on these matters. 
 
 As you will recall, the items under consideration were:
 
 a) The payment-in-lieu-of taxes for public works projects.  This has been done for San Jose and Palo Alto. 
 b) The payment for pre-petition physical purchases.  This is not part of the process for Palo Alto. 
 c) Implementation of the legal provisions creating incentive programs for private sector moneys - this is something the courts will have to determine after the Prop 8/16 appeals are over. 
 
 Given the political climate in California, we are of course not 
 anxious to implement these items for at least the near term.  In the event that we do manage to implement them, we 
 want to make sure that the incentives are clear and understandable to both sides of the 
 issue.  We have attached electronic 
 copies of the documents we are working with the Mayor and the County to enunciate, as well as oral assurances that 
 the funds will be there.  We also want to make sure that there will be a) written instrument to demonstrate that the assurances were 
 given and b) were genuine.

If not, I know her well.  I was Miss Representational and Representational Advancement at VMAC 2011.  She may be a good candidate to interview with DWR.  If not, I will send an email to her.

Thanks, Kate

 I would like to follow up with a couple of questions...
 
 1)   Do you know who the legal counsel is on the outside of HPLC to facilitate the smooth running of the gdp process?  I am not sure who is doing the drafting but I would like to ensure that we are on even footing when it comes to the drafting fees.
 
 2)   Ok - so that is a question for Ms. Bascom.  I am not sure who is doing the drafting but I would like to ensure that we are on even footing when it comes to the drafting fees.
 
 Ms. Bascom will be submitting written comments by Friday.  Let me know if you need me to add anything.
 
 Thanks,  Mrs.

 Dear Mrs. Fatima Rasheed Khalifa,
  
 As you know we have a legal  support group here that is very  involved in our tax relations.  It was Fredric's firm that drafted the Wilshire  agreement and we were also a part of the negotiations surrounding the transaction with  ENA.  In the event of a delay in the Wilshire deal,  I am not sure if I can help but to bring up that  the firm that drafted the agreement is also an Independent Contractor.  
 
 I do not want to add onerous  fees or penalties if the deal goes sour.  
 
 Good luck.
 
 Cheri

Dear The Managing Director,
Applying a couple of points from your reply email to Ms. Friel, here are the requirements for a Visa Application for Peruvian Corporate?   She does need to have a copy of her green card to evaluate our options.  Please let me know if I need to do anything.  Also, I was wondering if you could let me know if there are any fees or taxes that we need to pay to acquire the necessary permissions.  I am attaching a cover letter so that Ms. Friel can tell us whether or not there will be any charges on Purchasing Power.  If there are fees or taxes that we will not be able to recover, we will have to refer the matter to IR.

Please let me know if I need to do anything.  Also, I am attaching a white paper summarizing the rationale for the issuance of the Visa and the reasons for issuing the VISA. I will be available on Tuesday, February 22 to discuss these points.  

I Love Lucy

Hi Victoria,

I am not sure what we decided on Friday.  Are we going to reschedule one of the calls into Cap Gemini?  If so, I will let you know.

Also, I understand that we need to obtain a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement for this transaction.  Are you scoping this deal out in advance with Enron, or were you looking to sell this early?

Any chance of a phone interview with LeDain?

 I have more information on the status of the Enron metallurgical contract with DWR.  I spoke with Robyn this a.m. and she told me that DWR has paid the Steele DWR Letter of Credit for the month of February.  The contract contains fine print that requires Completion  of the Master Power Plan prior to Execution of the Agreement.  I contacted Robyn this a.m. and she was  asking me to send  her a copy of the Master Power Plan for Execution on or as soon as possible.  Could you give me a copy of this document at your  earliest so I can forward it to DWR?

 I held onto the 8th u-clause,  because I don't think either party wants to adopt that language unless  they have already agreed.  Lizzette does not want to pre-sign the agreement, either.  I'll get back to you ASAP with some  more info.

 Dear Ms. Lon,
 
 It was good to see you too.  I am not sure whether you are still involved with the drafting or  the signing of the documents, but my understanding is that if the documents are  draft and the Signing is done by EPMI, then the services will be accomplished on my behalf. 
 
 I have been working on the contingency plans for the event and one of the items that I am not sure of is the  amount of staff that will be needed to execute the swaps.  The  last time I reviewed the contingency plans, I did not include a  staff member to account for staff lost in the event of a power failure.  I am not sure whether  the area is closed to employees because of the trade or litigation experience, or both.  Could you  send me a copy of the proxy materials to facilitate our analysis?

 Mr. Wilkinson,
 
 As you know we have a contract that we executed in January that provides for the payment in November of 100% of the contract's purchase price.  This has not happened yet, but I am sure we can get you the payment in November.  The other item that is not reflected in the agreement is the purchase price for the counterparty.  Our hourly cost of sales is $16,000 and $12,000 of that is reflected in the price we charged Brooks for the counterparty.  I am not sure what the other $4,000 is.  The counterparty has not agreed in writing to anything for the $16,000 amount, or even the $12,000 level of invoicing that we are using.  I am not sure what the escrowed funds are for.  The funds will be paid back to the dealer in November.

 Tom - Nice to meet you.  I am a bit confused at 
 this meeting as to what you are doing, who is 
 responsible for what, and what is 
 expected of each of us?  
 I am not sure if you are planning to call us all or

 the status of your overseas dealings and legal matters?  I am not sure who is doing the checking/verification, 
 is it you or someone on your legal staff?  I did ask who is doing the checking/verification of import licenses, but 
 I am not sure who did the audit, but my understanding is that 
 it is your job to make sure there are no deficiencies in the licensing documents, 
 and I am not sure who is doing the checking/verification, so I am not sure who is the best candidate to ask to do the checking. 
 
 Let me know if you need any further information.

Dear Dr. William Regal,

I do not understand the problem with your response.  The document you were referring to was on the web site of the manufacturer of the power  system.  I found it on the web site of the power system that EPMI is negotiating with Duke on a power purchase agreement.  It is a draft and I think errors do occur.  Please, take a copy of this and send it to me so I can review it.  It appears that there is some confusion about the purpose of this letter.  Was this a contract amendment, application for a power purchase agreement, or is  this an official letter?  Please let me know if I need to  fax the completed letter to the Duke Energy Commission.

Very truly yours,

Dear MR JAMES SPENCER,

Just wanted to keep you informed of the status.  Helyette has said that after the close of the year she will like to ""discuss the legalities of the current agreements"" and I am not sure if ""the legalities"" entice us to continue with them.  If you would like to pass the correspondence onto me I will be happy to try to clarify the issue.

 We are having problems with our  SSL on the external tracings.  I have the interface ready but I am not sure how to use it.  The doc doesn't list any SSL problems on the internal.  What is your  ip?  I can't find any IPs on the master signed logs.  I did a Google query and saw that your pager is set up  in our cloud service.  Is that your pager also?  I will try to find out from Donna Greif how much she is going to be involved in these matters.  I do have a  draft of the formal for the deal that we are working on with DWR.  I may make copies for you if you want to  look at them.  They probably need a little more thought than others.  I am sorry that I did not bring them out for  evaluation the first time yesterday.  I am glad that they were so nice and well-behaved yesterday.  I did not want to start a domino effect.  I  think that the board was not in it for the long haul.  I am not sure what the issue is about the pagers.  I am glad that you had fun.  I will talk to you tonight.

 I'm not sure whether adequate notification has been received from PECO or 
 any of the transmission utility customers in California in accordance with Section 2 (2) (f) of the CAISO 
 Tariff.  I do not anticipate that the necessary papers will be received from PECO 
 within the next few days.  In the mean time, I would encourage PECO customers 
 to check with their financial advisor or attorney regarding the status of their contracts and to 
 consider the possibility of a draft in light of the volume of trading conducted on the NYMEX and the possibility that the proposed contract may be 
 invalidated by a timely filed request for a change of name.

Dear Mrs. M. Esq.   I am following up on your voicemail earlier today.  My main focus right now is on the new corporate entity structure we are about to implement.  Do you have any comments?  Vital things like directors, which are separate and apart from any conflicts of interest laws that apply to both the current entity and the new entity, are things that need to be worked out between the two.  I do not know exactly what the exact process is in the NY corp, but I did ask Sara if we could review her to make sure that there were no conflicts.  Tom would be responsible for getting the contracts executed in the NY corp.  I am not sure he returns the 3% phone call receipt on this.

The phone rings, and I can't answer it.  It sounds like a kid's voice says, ""Hi Mrs. Haney, how are you?""  I always have trouble answering the phone, so I'm not sure who it is.  Then I hear the message, and I'm like, ""What is that?""  I don't have an answer for you.  Go on, answer the phone. 

The other person on the other end of the line seems to be calling from a different number, and I'm like, ""What is that?""  Again, I don't have an answer for you.  Go on, answer the phone.

The funny thing about this is that both of these people seem to be pretty smart people, and they're calling from different parts of the world.  I'm not sure which one of them is actually an infant, but I think they're about the same age.  Probably around 12 or 13.  I'll get back to you asap.

Subject: YOUR WISH PROPOSAL  Dear Kate,   We have a question related to draft rules.   I am not sure which documents we should send to the covered entity(s), so  I am not sure if we should send them this draft.   The good news on this matter is that there is already a Master Agreement  covering this issue for sale to customers.   The only questions are (a) who will manage this agreement  and (b) will we be able to obtain regulatory approval for this new form of entity?   Unfortunately, I am not  able to obtain either (unless you  send me both the superseding and interim agreements).   Would you be able to fax them to me?).   Well, I am not sure either, except for the last question.   If you don't have both the superseding and interim  agreements, can you fax them to me.   Thanks.

I think  you are going to need a lot of help with this.  I attended Beth Perlman's floor meeting when she communciated the difference between the Estate and Netco. She said that Jay Webb would be talking with everyone that had been identified to go to Netco and that she would be talking with individuals that would be staying on with the Estate. She did tell the employees that if they were identified to go to Netco and had a problem with this then they should talk with her and HR. She also said upon deal closure if the Netco employees receive offers and they turn them down it would be a voluntary resignation.  She urged them to please talk with us now if there are any concerns. She also said that we have requested to offer same salaries, to bridge service, and to pay retention bonuses at the time of deal closure. In addition, she communicated that we have limited information but we would update the group when more became available. 

I am confident that we can get the word out. Thanks again.

 I agree with your suggestions, and we will correct those suggestions. 
 Best, 
 Mr. James
 
 Thank you for your email.  I have forwarded it to Juan, who will then work on getting the documents into Mex.  I am not sure which office it will be assigned to, as we have not signed any documents in Mex. yet.  I am hopeful to speak to you by phone at some point in the future, so if you or a designate could call now, I would appreciate it. 
 
 Thank you, and I agree with your suggestions, that Hello Inc. be  restructured to better align with its legal  position in the various jurisdictions.  I am not sure what the timeline is for  that process, though; I have not received any notice from either the California PUC or ENRON, let alone an  order like the one you sent in January.  I am not sure what the actual resolution chances are, either; the odds of this being  successful in California are slim to none.  From what I understand, either party can call the arbitrator and ask to arbitrage the costs and  benefits of various contracts and agreements entered into with different  participants.  Say, for example, we are both sides of the border and both  have contracts with Enron that requires we to enter into long-term contracts.  If the parties can't come to an agreement to reduce the  payments eventually, the chances are good that we will end up with different  balances.  As you will no doubt recall from your discussions with  Juan,  Granada can provide a more favorable trading environment than the California PUC or ENRON, but we need to sell the  product or risk default.  A neutral or even slightly favorable California PUC would be a big help, but I am not sure how much  help we need from you.  Are we talking about naming NEPOOL or a position of some kind?  If not, I will contact you to get your thoughts.
 
 Thanks, Kate

Just got off the phone with you.  Mr. Spencer Zakris is the attorney working with you on this subject matter.  He can advise you on what is good practice for this matter.  I have not seen any of these documents, but I will forward these to you in a few days.  In the mean time, I would like to get together--quickly--to discuss our legal position with respect to NAFTA, specifically, is it okay for us to draft a document and send it to the states, or should we draft a separate I take responsibility for completing the deal and mailing it to the states?  

If you have additional questions or comments please let me know.  Thanks.

Dear Mr.Bignumi,
Just got off the phone with Mr.Lavorato.  I met him at Niche to discuss his coming out party.  I was hoping to talk to him about his upcoming interview  at Niche, but his voice mail said he is staying away from the company just because, as he put it, they were ""busy"" this last week.  I am not sure what he is doing, however, I have not heard anything about it.  If you or a designate could let me know, I would appreciate it.  Mr.Lavorato, on the other hand, I am not sure that he is coming out this week.  I thought that he must be busy ""realistically"" this week, as usual for someone new to Niche, before the company announces anything.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me. I shall  be in Niche the week of July 10th. I was hoping to talk to you about anything else, but am not sure what is ""busy"" these days, aside from the ""big announcement"" that is sure to come up.  Personally, I am excited about the new management team, led by Gerald ""Bill"" Compe, as it will make taking Niche private a lot easier.  However, I am not sure that I will be able to speak to every person in the new group, so I am anxious to  meet you and Gerald on a day to day basis.  Have a nice day. I look forward to speaking with you and selecting a time for our meeting.

 I'm writing to you on behalf of David Baumbach.   I found a nice little condominium on the top floor of 1180 Fox Chapel St.  I am not sure what David owns but if he is willing to give me a ring I would be happy to check.  I am not sure at this point what David wants with this investment, however, I did get in touch with him and he does not seem to be very happy about the lack of information that is being provided to investors.  I have a few questions for you. 

Do you know who is paying for this?

If not I will find out and figure out what is the best way to approach this from an investor relations point of view.

 My Thoughts
 
 
 I am not sure what to make of the way that the MPLS terms are drafted.  The language in the first paragraph seems to me to be very specific about the MPLS obligations 
 that arise from the execution of the Master Agreeemnt and the execution of the Patricia 
 Agreement.  I am not sure how much is intended by the second paragraph, which says that the 
 parties ""willy nilly"" willy nilly ""willy nilly"" willy nilly ""willy nilly"" willy nilly ""willy nilly"" willy nilly ""willy nilly"" willy nilly ""willy nilly"" indent to ""willy nilly"" the date that California will issue 
 the initial coin and initial business licenses.  I am not sure what this does or does not mean.  
 
 I am also not sure what the status of our California initial business is with respect to this lawsuit.  
 
 I did some more digging and found out that Matthew Dayton is the attorney that we talked to about getting these documents filed.  I 
 am not sure whether these documents are being kept in California or whether they are 
 being used by the MPLS to implement their contingency plans.  I am not sure which documents to use, but I 
 think that these documents are more specifically designed to support the contingency and legal opinions that we 
 are getting out into the market.

Hi Jess,

Hope you had an enjoyable Thanksgiving.  I found out the ""scoop"" on the stock contract.  I called the draft contract and it looks like you were going to

This account was opened in 1997 and the account has no beneficiary.

Dear joseph kangami,

I am not sure how you feel about the proposed transactions below.  Please let me know so that we can discuss.

How are you?  

I'm fairly well, but I'm not sure I know what the pain threshold is for what I'm doing.  I guess I could be working on it as an independent contractor, but then who knows where my time will be.  

What are your hours when you come in?  I know I can count on you.

I'm sorry I've been a little tight-lidded lately, it really has been an overwhelming experience.  I've been working non-stop this past week and definitely nowhere near the top of my list of priorities, so it will be good to take a break and get some rest.  Maybe I can take a day or so to unwind a little.  At the least I will be working on the logistics of the conference, buying me some more time.

I will try to bring something new, new ideas, or new media for discussion of the plan, whichever comes first.

If you or a designate could let me know as soon as possible, I would appreciate it.

Thanks, Kate

Hello, Kate.  My name is Melissa Ann Murphy.  I work in the corporate communications group.  My boss is Tim Ryan, and he and I often disagree on certain things regarding communication in the organization.  For example, we think that it is a good idea to have a technical support person (or TSP) on staff to answer all of the technical questions and  help clarify the legal language around the teletype system.  Have a pleasant Thanksgiving.

Signature - please introduce yourself and let me know.

 I found the attached names of two addresses: one in San Jose, California, the other in Irvine, California.  They are about 6 blocks apart.
 
 I will be glad to send separate letters to you explaining why I believe we should be together in writing in order to facilitate our eventual arrangement.
 
 Please let me know in the mean time.

 Dear Vince,
 
 I am writing on behalf of the person who will be taking over from you as Chairman and CEO of Enron, Richard Kinder.  In my previous correspondence with you, I made a number of assumptions and had insufficient information to enable me to determine whether any of the assumptions were accurate or not.  In this letter, I have revised some of the more basic assumptions and am attaching a summary of the changes.  In addition, I have changed the date to October 1, 2001.  In addition, I have shortened the notice to 150 days and added an item describing the basis for the proposed contract.  Finally, I have inserted a paragraph or two on the proposed contract so that it is clear what the basis is and what it will not do.  The final document will then be changed to reflect the revised assumptions and provisions.  This letter is to be sent by registered mail to the legal representative named on file with the SEC.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  

 I hope that I will have the opportunity to meet and  discuss with you in person or by phone on Monday, October 22.  

 Sincerely,
 
 
 Your Excellency

 Dear Mr. Mohammed,
 
 I am not sure whether adequate notification has been received from PECO or  ComEd since our previous meeting.  In my previous communication, I did not indicate our intention to seek  reimbursement for the costs of  the physical commodities we will be importing.  Is it more  likely that ComEd will not pay for the physical  commodities, than that PECO will agree to include in  future payments for the same work?   I do not know whether ComEd  has any obligation at this time to include in future payments  for the same work, or even any duty to include it.  In either event, I  think it is more likely that ComEd will agree  on a work by date than any future date that might be assigned by market  fluctuations.  In either event, though, it is likely that ComEd will have an incentive to include the  work, so long as the market there allows for  a change in the visual appearance of the balance sheet to reflect that fact.
 
 Regards,
 
 Mohammed

Thank you for your email.  I do not know the answer to your question, other than perhaps you are working on it right now?   Sure, I can help you with that.   I am not sure at this time whether we should be working together, since we may not know each other's motives or intentions.  To avoid unnecessary confusion, I am coordinating the information to make sure all the relevant information is presented at the right time.   I apologize for the delay in the past, and will try to coordinate the work on both email and paper.  

I wanted to see your voicemails for this meeting.  Some of the points you made were not discussed with David Freeman or Jackie by name, but are more accurately expressed in your emails.     I suggest you to bring up the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters of next week as the new CEO will most likely have some questions.   You can work the answers or all of the time.

I think I covered all of my bases.  I could have gone into a little more detail about what I was seeking to communicate with the investor but I was under the impression that all deals should be ""post-petition"".  I was also under the impression that all funds should be ""present"" at the transaction's ""petition signing"".  So, I considered the statements in RESP 6 through 12.  I'm not sure if RESP 6 was all that was needed, but I considered it complete given that it summarizes the key points of our pitch for Merced irrigation investment and shows how our compensation plans and structures could be used to reward performance.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Title: Greetings.
 Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. Greetings. I am Mrs. Gangeswary Kumar, husband to late Mr. Kumar Gangeswary. I was married to Mr. Kumar Gangeswary for eleven years without a child. During this period we were both  highly successful farmers. After the death of our husband, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which  the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive, he deposit the sum of $30,000,000 (Thirty Million, Fifty  thousand United States Dollars) with one of the Financial institution where he declared his interest. I have asked him to contact any of his extended  circle of business associates to facilitate the movement of this money to his country. He  advised that I should seek for a foreigner to stand as a next of kin to my late husband so that  I can transfer this money into his personal account abroad. I want  you to understand that the Bible is not in favor of polygamy and I don't  want you breaking the law. The Bible is very strict in this  matter. As soon as you accept to stand as a next of kin to my late husband,  you will be  able to transfer this money to his account. I will provide all necessary  details regarding the security and custody of this fund to you. I will also  issue to you a letter of authority/Power of Attorney that will prove you as the  next of kin to my late husband. I want you and the group of  you to always pray for me because the Lord work in mysterious ways. My happiness  is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the  Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through  your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a  Christian individual to carry out this  task for us. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein  in my letter of authorization.  Hoping to hearing from you. Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. Yours in Christ, Mrs. Gangeswary Kumar.  YE MAIL ADDRESS IS:chamberedriveback@yahoo.fr

Dear Ganeswary Kumar ,
 
I'm not sure what else to say.  Although your thoughts are very different from mine, I think we can at least try to agree on one thing...
 
 I'm sorry that I didn't get back to you sooner.  
 I think we've already started the process of shutting down the business.  There are too many transactions at this point to keep up with all of the 
 transactions.  I need to put into motion all the legal things that might need to be 
 done in order to carry out this transaction.  In addition, I need to understand what your plans are for the 
 legal department in an effort to understand the different trading hours that I work.  
 With that said, I do have positive things to report about the economy in general.  One of the things that 
 I was concerned about when I heard the news about the S&P 500 deal is how quickly it might turn into a problem for us if things 
 break loose.  I don't know exactly what the timeline is for all of this, but from what I've read about the 
 deals made by Mike Syeda, it seems like we could get down to business right away.  I mean, hypothetically, we could get the paperwork out today and start the 
 trading session tomorrow.  By the way, I am passing along to you today Dr. Pawel Kowalski, the legal department 
 of CCC paralegal Sandra Day Greif, who was instrumental in getting the mergers approved in the first place.  She is 
 looking for additional space in our files to house all of this correspondence.  If you have any questions, concerns, or comments, please let me know.
 
 Thanks.

Dear marouane ashraf,
Could you please email me the hello.html so I can load it into e-mail?  Also, I am not sure what is going on with the legal opinions.  If you have them, I would be happy to review them.
 
 Guillaume,  I received your email request regarding Lexington Furniture Internet.  I am not sure what to make of it, aside from maybe it is their deal...if I can't see them anywhere online, I am not sure what they are about.  Please let me know.  That is all.  I will give you a call later and talk about this with him.  I do not want to raise expectations on that particular call.  I am not sure if it is too much to expect that sort of thing, but I guess that is my wife's style.  I shall just be as ready to help as you are.
 
 My cell phone number is (717) 254-5996.  My fax number is (717) 254-7756.  If you would like to speak to me on the telephone, I am available on the phone from 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. today.  I am quite familiar with this sort of thing, having been with both Enron and PECO, and am quite sure which side those documents are on.  If you or a designate could let me know in a few minutes to coordinate the drafting of the documents, I would be happy to coordinate the efforts of the legal department and the drafting desk.

Our discussions had been going on for some time now, and I had hoped that we would have a positive response from them on the trading floor.  Unfortunately, there has been some misunderstanding as to our actual positions and I am not sure  who is doing the interpreting for the day to day trading performance.  Please let me know if I can help you out.

 I believe we can make the statement in 20.3.3.2.3 [basic.text.20.3.3.2.3] as amended.  That is, the statement is 
 
 verbiage about the nature of the agreement, i.e., a MISO one, that is, than a final and binding contract 
 that incorporates the Merced energy savings initiative, and the fact that the Merced energy market is currently 
 limited to fixed costs.  
 
 Let me know if that is not the case.  
 3. 
 I am not sure what is meant by the second paragraph.  says ""and (d) the payment-in-lieu-of-fines payments"" that are supposed to be 
 computed based on the underlying sums of payments.  i.e., the sums of payments for the months 
 involved in the analysis are not supposed to be separate and distinct from the underlying 
 balances and payments.   
 
 Can you explain what is meant by the phrase ""and (d) the payment-in-lieu-of-fines payments"" 
 in the analysis above?  I don't think it is a direct translation of the Greek, but 
 it is close enough to be translatable, and it rhymes.  Let me know.
 
 Thank you.

 As you know we've got quite a bit of work to do to freshen up our credit.  It's been 
 heavily staff reviewed and there are a lot of issues at play here.  
 The big three are 1) do we want to publish the copyright assignment and the pre-emptive 
 strike against any attempted merger or consolidation of the credit; 2) do we want to 
 include in the credit unifying language so the 12 different credit tiers can be identified; and 3) I'm not sure we 
 can't include the counterparty language that would identify the counterparty as the original obligor.
 
 Have a happy New Year.

I know this mail will come to you as a surprise and if I am not understood/succesful, please, allow me to introduce myself to you. My name is Daniel  M.

I left the country with my mother and our only son, and am now seeking political asylum in one of the  neighboring countries. Recently, my doctor told me that I  had a dormant medical condition that would give me around  24 hours to live. This is a result of my  poor health as can be seen by the fact that I have not been seen in  a very long time. Also, I have not had any child  in the form of a born, adopted, or grandchild, all I have  is my mother's blood. If this is  not the intention of you, I urge you to disregard this and keep  away from me. Then, when your time comes, I will  give you all the information  needed to have me as your  next of kin.  I have all the necessary  information we need to accomplish this task. My  mother's relatives have already confirmed that  she is who she says she is, she never told  me that she has changed her mind and that the  man she husband used to husband used to her is not her  husband.  I will give you all the  contact name of my mother as well as the phone  number of her office. If you accept to help me and treat with  utmost confidentiality, I will be very glad.  If you do not, I will send to you all the  relevant documents pertaining to this transaction immediately.  With best regards, Daniel M.  M. CAIN.

I am very sorry to hear about the unfortunate events of the past 24 hours.  I was hoping you were going to call us before you went missing.  We have all been informed of what is to come and what is expected of us.  This particular assignment is different though.  It is not a normal desk and so the needed changes have not yet occurred. The news of your assignment has come as a shock.  You will be involved in a great deal of  new responsibilities and I am not sure exactly what those will be but I am sure you will find out soon.  To those who were involved in the decision to send you on this assignment, I am not sure whether you were involved in the process of why.  Perhaps we will find out together.  As regards to your response, I am not sure how counsel will be utilized in this instance since your lawyer is not available.  If you have a lawyer, I would like to hear from him.  If you do not intend to use him, then why not me.

 Dear Mr. Spartan,
 It was a pleasure talking with you and attending your presentation at State Farm.  I am a big State Farm guy, but I think I've always enjoyed his side projects.  I'm not sure which ones, but they probably stem from previous engagements.  When you came to Austin, I hoped to ask you about your State Farm experience and whether you were asked to negotiate provisions of contracts for future engagements.  My guess would be no.  What have been your experiences like?  Any special events you were going to throw a party to mark the occasion?

Andrea

""Skipper,  
 
 I will be attending State Farm's annual meeting at the end of October.  I am not sure about my location in the schedule, but at the reception I will be 5:30 until then.  I am not sure about my suit - it may change after the meeting.  If you have any questions,   send me an e-mail or call.

 Good day Lloyd James,  Chambered in 14000 rounds per box. I have a new email address! You can now email me at:  joseph_kangami@yahoo.com A young man who must have passed through my email as he did not use it for the first time. I am Mr.Joseph Kangami, the man from South Africa who was the ring leader of the AFRIQUE MONEY PENDING FROM THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION,  which  is the body that deals on the international transfers of gold and other precious goods. I have in my possession, the sum of $15,000,000.00, which is twenty-five percent (25%) of the total money, and five percent (5%) for the expenses that may be incurred by us during the transfeiture, and another five percent (5%) to cover any expences that may be incurred by me during the course of transfeiture. I have the address of a security company that provides security for important commercial properties, and I have never disclosed the presence of this consignment to any security company. I have therefore met with the company to discuss the modalities of its delivery to the security company, which is currently under negotiation, but as presently the proposed transfeiture deals mainly with foreign partners. If you can be of an assistance to me, I would be pleased to apply to the company for the transfer of this deposit to your account. You will be given a negotiable percentage for your participation, and further details will be sent to you as soon as I hear from you. Regards and respect, Joseph KANGAMI Secretary, International Remittance Department

Re: The Beneficiary

Dear Mrs. Ramsey,   I have no answer for this.  Go to the web site and look it up.  I don't  know who is supposed to pay for this.  If you think you  are supposed to pay for it, you are wrong.  There is no date on the lease.  From what I understand, it  will be paid for on a straight lease basis throughout.  If we meet later in the  week to discuss lease terms, then let me know.  

If you want me to write a letter to the effect that we  will be in communication with you regarding the status of the payments, then let me know.  

Let me know at your convenience.

Dear Mr. Guy Eduard.   I am a student of Economics at UC Berkeley.  I was wondering if you were attending that lunch attended by Arora and Solow last week.  If not, I was attending that ""biz-jamaica"" dinner.  I do not know what you were doing, what you were saying, or who was saying what.  Perhaps, next time I am in the market for an economist, I should steer clear of you.  Otherwise, I intend to ask several of my superior's name.  I am not sure at this time what they are doing or saying.  If you have a phone, I could use Phil to find out what they are saying.  If you do want to do an interview, I am available that evening.  By the way, I am not sure at this point who is paying for all this.  I have passed along to you Colin's memo on Arora and Solow.  I am not sure why he is the only one bringing any notes.  Do you know who Phil is calling from?  

I am not sure at this time what will be good phone number to use to reach me.  As a result, it will be better if I call you.  Although I understand that you are probably busy right now, I am not sure why you would want to do that.  Besides, you might be used by someone else.  Phone: (877) 4-HELP (3323)  T: (503) 826-2201

If you or a designate can find the person with the  telephone and other information necessary to locate the needed person, we will post the necessary documents, so  that it may be noted on the return shipping records.  Since I am not sure who is answering the  phone, I can't give you an address unless I have your signature.  Will you please  check the box that I checked and the confirmation that I should expect is on the mailbox  when I get home from work today?

Hi Kate,

I am not sure what to wear this year but i do have a pretty bright pink & white jersey with chain-mail trim that i am using this year.  It is a bit fancy for someone my age, but i think that says a lot about who i am becoming.  It is such an honour to be able to do this with all the attention on myself.  Anyways, i am not sure what to say or do.  I am glad you are having a great holiday season.  I am very shy and not at all comfortable around others.  At the risk of sounding self-important, i think for someone my age to be able to express themselves in ways that others are not, it is a great sign.  I am not sure what to wear next, between the suits or tops?  Personally, i am liking the suit a lot more than the rest, partly because it is my first suit and i am not sure which suit it is i am going to get.  Do you know which one it is which one of these guys is it a guest of honor?  Lol maybe i will just bring one of those things home and hem the tickets for you.  I am not sure which suit is which, but we can go back to the drawing board when we get some extra time.  Oh well, i am not sure which one i am not getting, so i will just make a note in the back of the ticket and i will mark it down.  The tickets are a bit pricey ($220-250) but honestly i think its a pretty big win when you consider the amount of time i

Dear KAM IBRAHIM     I certainly didn't expect to receive from you such a warm and fuzzy feeling in our relationship over the last several months.  At that point, I did not even realize that there were other people like me who felt the same way.  In fact, I felt a great deal of distance already exists between us as entrepreneurs, engineers, and scientists.  Perhaps it will be some time before we meet again, but I am hopeful that someday we will be able to connect again.  To the best of my knowledge, your email did not come through; however, I found a copy of it on your desk.  I take it that you are going to be attending Cornell.  In my previous job, I used to do a lot of work with you on financing and strategy for early stage companies.  As I remember it, you were very involved in the process of selling the Subway commercial franchisees.  I am not sure what your plans are for this venture, but I certainly wouldn't want to be involved in the decision-making process.  If you have any questions, I would be more than happy to address them.  By the way, I feel kind of strange talking to you on the phone.  I assume you are going to be attending grad school in business administration this summer, which is going to be a great way to get some experience.  Would you speak with us by phone if at all possible so we do not bother each other and go our separate ways?

 GOOD DAY Attn: Sir/ Madam, Please permit me to introduce myself to you. I am Mrs.Lilian Taye, the daughter of late Chief Charles Taye, of the blessed memory. I am writing this letter with due respect and heartful of tears since we have not known or met ourselves previously. I am making this letter to seek your assistance and also to secure an opportunity to invest and do joint business with you in your country. I would be honoured if I could be of assistance to you, which I know is a divine right given my father's position as the highest authority in my country. He createdamemble with me , am a solo mother of three, which is a stark contrast to the society where I am oppressed and suffer from insecurity of residence. Plus, I don't want to invest or do any business in his country where I am not in a position to have a major impact on the life of the family, as I am the only one with the legal documents to back up any given claim. I would be most grateful if you could allow me and my father look for a role model in your country who could guide and guide us, like a god fearing individual who will not sit on our behalf should we not prove him/herself. I would like to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you, my life is so much easier now that I have recovered my freedom and independence. I am now in possession of a secured business passport and I am ready to commence any contract that would be of mutual benefit to us, especially as I have already taken legal measures to ensure a no risk situation on the outcome of any given transaction. For your percentage, I would like you to provide me with your telephone and fax numbers for quick communication, as I will be contacting you shortly to confirm the details of your business or if not, for the necessity of a third party to assist us on any lucrative business we may consider. I will be glad to reserve this respect and opportunity for you, if you so desire, but do urge to keep this transaction strictly confidential and execute this transaction on my behalf if I am available. Expecting to hear from you soon. Remain blessed. Yours faithfully, Lyse Doum.

Title: GOOD DAY
 GOOD DAY Attn: Sir/Madam. My name is Mrs. Elizabeth Kangaro, I'm a widow to Late Engr. James Kangaro, who unfortunately lost his life during the Viet Nam War. I am 65 years old, and am suffering from esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I was never a very good person. I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations when I was well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United States, Asia, Middle East &amp; Europe, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as  they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of Twenty Eight Million Dollars ($28,000,000.00) that I have with a finance/Security Company Abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations. I have set aside 10% for you. Please get in touch with me on my preferred email address: me@jamesangaro.com or my official email address: me_officially_jamesangaro@yahoo.com God bless you as you help me. Regards and Respect, Mrs. Elizabeth Kangaro.

 I am totally open to wherever you think would be best.  If possible, it would  also be good if there were a few minutes to chat.  I am not sure what to expect from  me today, other than perhaps a brief greeting and a  couple of minutes of introductory remarks.  I have no particular particular interest in  speaking to the credit, so that may be unnecessary.  If, on the other hand, I should learn that you are about to speak, please  immediately change your plans and tell me what you are planning to say.  I am not sure what to expect when you  speak English.  I have not heard anything about what is coming out of  China, so I am not sure what to make of the economic stuff.

 Hey Felicia,
  
 I'm good with the changes.  Just some additional info.
 
 I was under the impression that Lisa  was going to be going to China with us this  weekend.  I am not sure exactly where we were going to be eating, but 
 I had in mind things like Chick-Fil-A, Suites, and the like.  That being said, I am not sure that  the morning after we leave for China I want to make sure that the embers  are still there before I let them know that we are 
 leaving.  I have spoken for all of my vacation days.  I take the afternoon off today and tuck away

 Let me know when you have a time that I can get with you.

1.  What is the payment schedule for the work that you propose we do jointly?  Especially since I believe we have different priorities and people.

I have been meeting with corporate in Hong Kong, and there were some  questions that I would like to put to company  first.  How much does Company Hong Kong represent, and what is its relationship with the rest of the group?  

If you have a better answer, I would be more than happy to address those questions.  But  for the record, I do not believe that I have a question regarding the fairness of the award.  The arbitrator in this case was appointed for a term of 6 months and has already proven himself to be fair and impartial.  The contract includes a provision that if the company fails to get adequate notice or justification for cancelling the prior written notice period, the consumer may not recover damages.  I am not sure what this means - a breach of contract charge only accrues to the party that didn't get adequate notice or justification for cancelling the prior written notice period - but if we have a firm date for the termination of the contract, I am willing to let that expire.  The second matter relates to the contractual provision that provides for payment in advance for future services not rendered.  If the service delivery dates or times for future deliveries seem unclear, you may want to consider contacting John for clarification.  Otherwise, I am not sure whether the timing provision was added or not.  If you or a designate could let me

 Mr. Chairman and Mrs. Walker:
  I am calling to discuss options for dispositively transferring corporate jurisdiction for PF&E.  I  do not know the answer to this question, but my  preliminary thinking is that we should be able to determine from the outset whether we will be  representing the financial situation of the entity with fixed  commissions that are proportional to the performance of its  obligations.  If you have additional  ideas, please do not hesitate in sharing them.
 
 
 Ms. Ong:
  I am very familiar with the PF&E  situation.  
 
 In a nutshell, it boils down to three options:
 
 Option 1: The 5% ratio of their initial to cash flow is what we  are representing to the market.  For PF&E, this is what they  are representing.  If you will permit me to quote from the  letter that we sent to the NYISO, then you can see what the market  thinks about the ratio.  According to the  I.Q. of the SME that we are evaluating,  they think that it is about 25%.  They  are right on the money on this.  The reason that they are not getting paid more is  they have not been contributing to the mix sheet.  Paul is going to be the point person on this, and he  is very good at his current role.  He can be a huge hit or miss at this point, but I am  confident that as we get more and more experience with this issue, he will get better.  I am not sure how the market will react to this, but I  think that you will see a benefit if you let the market decide.  
 
 Option 2: They say that they are going to market on a ""sometime this summer.""  I am not sure what the schedule is going to be this summer, but I  will take a look at it and let you know.
 
 Mr. Johnson:
  I think that we can make the move fairly easily.  We can put something like a website up and we can move the  files around.  I am not sure that we are doing a very good job of justifying the time investment.  I  know that we will most likely have something up  and running pretty soon.

Dear Paul Richard Pezzullo,

I appreciate your candid feedback on the text of the email I just  received from Dianne Feinstein.  My only response is that I don't know what it means or  who it is addressed to.  There is also the matter of the calendar.  I don't know who approved of this letter and what  it is used for.   Please let me know if I don't respond.

 Dear Ms. Seal,   I do not know whether adequate notification was received from you or not, but I do know that  after you left me a message in the morning reiterating your intent to send a  thank you  message, that is when I would send an invoice.   I am not sure if it is the same person, but I  think that is the only identifier that will be helpful.  Do you have a copy of this letter that you can  use to verify the information in the invoice?  If not, I am not sure who is.   I will be glad to make copies for you.   Sincerely,   Carrie

 Thank you very much.  It has been an honor talking with you and attending your  banquet.  I am not sure if I have been formally introduced, but  probably by now.  I attended Beth Perlman's talk and was immediately struck  by how warm and friendly everyone was.  It was so  that I would never have to leave the house without having  someone  introduce me.  It is still a work in progress, but  I feel like I have made friends along the way.  Who are your  friends?   If you have any questions,

 Dear Carolyn,
 
 I have more information on the status of the divorce case from outside counsel.  The case is still active, though I am not sure if there will be  any briefs.  I don't know what phase the case is in, since  it is not reported in the Merrell Cole Transact-Based Execution  Report.  What do you think?

 Mrs. Isabella Abdul Kadir. My Dear Friend, I am Mrs Isabella Abdul Kadir  from Yemen. I am married to Late Mallam Isada Abdul Kadir. I have a proposition to make to you. As you may or may not know, my husband is the former Vice-president of Yemen who was overthrown out of power by American Government . During the current war in Yemen, my husband was able to get on the plane and fly to Dakar Senegal. After the war in Yemen, my husband acquired a small diamond export company and shipped the diamonds to Europe, Asia and America. Unfortunately, the diamonds got into the wrong hands. The diamonds got into the wrong hands during the fighting in Yemen. As a result, my husband suffered injury and died on 4th of July in hospital. But before his death, he disclosed the content of the crate containing the diamond to me, he said that it was a hand gemstone and that I should not invest or produce anything in the company. He advised that I should leave the country immediately as soon as possible, if I do not become his partner in the country.  I want you to help me to ship the contents of the crate to any country of your choice and also reunite with my children who are not yet grown up. Please, I will like you to indicate your interest and assistance to me as soon as possible, so that I can introduce you to the best companies and individuals that can assist me in shipping the contents of the crate to your chosen location. I will give you 20% of the total amount after the transaction is successfully concluded. I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous relationship between both of us. May God bless you as you help us. Yours Sincerely, Mrs Isabella Abdul Kadir.

Mrs. Isabella Abdul Kadir:   Dear Mrs.   Isabella.   I have a few questions for you.  How much time will you be needing from her?  If possible, she could use the summer to get away from us.  What is her schedule like?  I am glad you were able to attend our 7th luncheon.  My name is Neda Anwar.  I work at Enron Research with Karen Ballard.   I attended Beth Perlman's remarks.   I was not in the room that she spoke at, but I heard some of the things she said and thought that Mr.  Farber had said.  A couple of things:   1)  Mr. Farber is not going to be taking a vacation day today.  I heard that he had some things he would be doing.  2)  I am not sure that the easement issue will be resolved this week.  I heard that Daren's bill was pending and that Phil was trying to get on the exempt effective this week.  Do you know what the status of those bills is?  We may or may not have any documents to show that Daren and Phil are even together.  Given the current information we have, it is probably best to just say that they are not.  If you or a designate can get the documents off of Daren's file, I will be glad to provide them to you.  Otherwise, I am not sure whether the papers even need to be filed.

Sorry for the delay in responding.  I have one thing on Sullivan's Statement that I would like to ask you about.  Is that cover letter you sent out inviting Daren Farmer to come to Enron?  I am not sure if it is okay to make the statement.

I will be in a position to make a statement regarding the accounts receivable should Daren decide to

Dear Mrs. Azura Amanda Akpobono,
I am not sure how far along we are with Samantha.  Some of the calendar days are still being worked.  I do not have a lot of information.  If you did wire, it would be Jan.  However, Mr. Falkand (my attorney) said recently that he had talked to Ms. Zenig (my attorney) and that she was going to be at least partially available on the calendar.  Also, I took the liberty of adding a statement about the representations of Merced irrigation.  The representation, it should be obvious, is not significant.  And finally, I decided not to include in the filing any information on contingency planning, since that is beyond the purview of the contingency statement.  Given the current calendar, however, we may not have any time to prepare an answer to your question.  Will you call later?  

Sincerely,

Amy

On Tue, 24 Oct 2000 Marty O'Leary and I discussed with Samantha Buckthurstieck the contingency in CASH that would be used to cover the costs of preparing and filing the necessary papers if Enron were to go private.  My guess is that we will need to issue some sort of a 'soft money' certificate for CDWR and CDWR will most likely need that to finance its expenses.  Personally I am of the opinion that CDWR will be issued a CDWR Agreement in the future and I am not sure what the schedule is for when that will be.  I do not see any reason not to move as soon as possible.

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received  from outside counsel, Bruce Kay.  Thanks.

 We had a great time at the party in Austin and I am not sure if I have mentioned this before but Steve is really good friends with Matt Camp, President of ENA and EPMI.  Their son, Austin, just turned 19 and is planning to major in accounting this summer.  They are really excited about his plans and expect him to make a huge impact on the accounting world.  They also pointed him in the direction of Ian at Global Markets, who is leading the way in the audit profession in that space.  I am not sure what he will be doing next, but they do have a great deal of insight into their client's finances and will be advising on how to best capture that into the audit.  I am not sure what the exact schedule is going to be, but I thought that I would bring it up so that you will be aware of its existence.

Dear Miss Helen  Wong jr.    I would like to introduce myself.  I was born in Canada and raised in Calgary, but have been living in Bangkok, and currently study in London.  I was not aware that there was an entity called Pattaya Group  which is separate and apart from the CAG.  I am not sure what the  arrangement is between the two, if any.  

As you probably already know, I do not believe that we should be paying affiliate income unless they also should be receiving a fee.  I am also not sure that affiliates should be paying into a fund which, in my  opinion, is a very inefficient use of available credit.  I am not sure that there is anything in the by-laws which would require them to include a  fee.  Given the size of the project, and the complexity of the arrangements involved, I am not sure that we can afford to lose sight  of the fact that this is a fee agreement.  Can you direct the two pieces of work to be done by our then-Chief Operating Officer,  Jo Ann McElhany, to-date compensation knowledge, and direct them both to you in-house?

I am working on a feature film here about 2 weeks and i am not sure when i will be able to film it, so i am hoping to meet you at least once.  I am not sure Hobart and Lindyfords are related; if you have any questions, please send me an email.

Thanks, kjj

 From John H Pritchard Dear Sir, It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a suprise. This is because we have not met before but I have  ascertained from the  information gathered from the Internet, that you do not have to go any further than this initial  e-mail to receive this simple acknowledgement. I am Mr Honest John H Pritchard, the son of the late Chief Paul Pritchard, a former  director of operations for General Motors UK.  I am contacting you because I want you to assist me in selling in your country  the remaining of my fathers' Cargoment stored in a security company in Europe.  I will be contacting you as soon as I hear from you. Best Regards, John H. Pritchard.

Dear Honest John H Pritchard,

On being contacted by Chris Foster to arrange a phone interview with Juan, I was greatly tempted to pass up the opportunity to meet his  manager, but in the interest of fairness, I think that this is a good idea even for someone new.

Can you let me know so that I may take into account the fact that I may be working with  someone else in the future?

If you have other questions, I will be happy to address them.

Best regards, Pete

 Dear Mr. McGuinness,
 
 I have no immediate plans to meet with Mark today.  However, as you will recall, my schedule for the meeting is quite 
 I am sure he will be in the area.  Given the current uncertainty, I 
 would like to make sure we registered as required under the Sarbanes 
 Protocol, which I executed in accordance with the instructions 
 that I received from George (see attached file entitled, 
 'Regulatory Compliance Guidance for Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Holders and Contractors'), I 
 am not sure how else to obtain your attention but the short answer is that 
 we need to get this over to you ASAP!  We have a 
 very steep learning curve vis-à-vis this new activity, although our clients have already 
 embraced this change.  We need to fix that ASAP!
 
 As a reference, I am attaching you the memo that we executed in accordance with the 
 new LEC guidance on Tuesday, February 16.  That memo is available on my desk 
 and I think my notes were setup in accordance with that guidance as well.  Let me know if you need me to 
 do anything.
 
 Best,
 Kathleen

 Dear Ms. Calendar,
 
 I am not sure whether adequate notification has been received from PECO or 
 any of its suppliers regarding the proposed contract administration or 
 determination as to the propriety of the suppliers' use of their positions under the 
 MAP.  I therefore request a provisional contracting procedure so that the 
 parties may submit bids under the MAP.  Can you advise how we can assist in obtaining confidence 
 that the proposed acquisition will not compromise the credit quality of the 
 parties' agreements?
 
 Mr. Gubbins.  
 Thank you for your email and I am pleased to meet with you.  I 
 have a few minutes of introductory remarks, so please 
 give me a few minutes.  I am making slight adjustments in the proposed contract to make it 
 as congruent as possible with the information we already know about PECO 
 and the proposed MAP.  That is all I am asking for...that is, you give me a 
 few minutes...maybe you can give me a call later and discuss.   I 
 am already working on the documents you sent me yesterday.  They are 
 pretty darn complicated and I am not sure which ones you are referring to.  If you are not sure, I 
 can give you a general idea of what the documents mean.  
 Thanks, and have a good day.

Apparently Michelle got wind of what was going on with the Southwest deal and is trying to negotiate provisions of the contract that would allow us to bid on the administrative and marketing costs.

 From Mr. Rashidi Hasan Tel:+92-337416 Email: rashidi@zwallet.com With due respect trust and humility, I write you this proposal regarding a potential investment.I have the privilege of introducing myself to you based on my status as a journalist and my integrity as a business man. I am Rashidi Hasan the son of Major Hasan Panahi Hasan, former Iraqi refugee and a business merchant based in Côte d’Ivoire. I am contacting you in regards to my father's investment fund which he kept for us in a security company in Dakar,Senegal, upon his successful unconditional release from prison on August 2002.Presently,this fund is in the security company for safekeeping as a trunk box containing valuables and secret notes of high value. My father deposited this fund with a private Security company, that till date has kept the box containing the fund as a trunk. Lets say its worth $30 000,00USD. Due to the nature of this business, its highly confidential and the security company did not know the content of the box. The security company does not know that its contents are secret notes of high value. The security company does not want the fund to be released to the public as that would entail disclosing confidential information about the contents to the security company. Hence the reason I am contacting you, because I don’t want to divulge any part of the contents to the security company. This is because the content of this box is confidential and all the secrecy rests on my name as the only son. I am contacting you because I don’t want to go against the flow of this transaction. Hence the reason for writing to you. I will send you all necessary information including the contact of the Security company where the fund was deposited. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of the fund. I will issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of the fund. I will not relent until the fund is returned to you. I want you and the company to always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted son. If you have doubts,just remember that I was a true devoted son and that I  lived a life of a true devoted son. If you have doubts,just remember that I was a devoted son.

I did not see him, but Patty said  he was a young, bright, and fun guy.  She praised  him for having a great sense of humor and said  he makes great TV guests.  She did ask me if I had ever  met Larry Page, and if I knew him, I would know he is very  busy.  She also said  he had a lot of explaining to do, and I was wondering if you could give me a few minutes.  I am not sure what the next move is going to be,  but I do have some explaining to do.

Although I don't think it is neccesary for me to do so, it may be beneficial if we do so.  The main points of the article are 1) the legality of the contingency clauses and the GGPs; 2) the effect of the contingency clauses on trades outside of normal business hours; and  3) the effect of the trading day on trades before the close.  Please  let me know the general gist of the positions and tell me if there are any questions.

Before his death we were both of us super-soldiers of the sky beast. During his illness, he secretly called me and told me of his will, which stated that all the money he deposited with a security company should be used to purchase of agricultural machinery and to establish up a company of his own. The security company did not know the content of the will but it was sufficient for me to call the security company to know the content of the will. Presently, I and my only son are on the move to Europe to find a reliable business partner. Please contact me immediately if you can be of assistance to me as we are of the same national,faith. Best Regards, Mrs. Sofia Anu

Dear Mrs. Sofia Anu,

I am not sure how long I will remain in Houston, but my thoughts are with you right now.  I was under the impression that you would be attending the CDWR board meeting, but I am not sure about the other meetings.  If you could let me know, I would be glad to draft a news release regarding the credit status of CDWR, as I believe there is some  confusion about the structure of the new entity.  Ted

 Tomioka, in response to your question, I did not receive a response from Ed Binns at all.  I do not know what his status is with respect to the discussions going on between the legal departments of Enron and EPMI, but I did receive a legal opinion regarding Patina Oil and Gas, and I am not sure whether Ortenberg or somebody is handling those negotiations.  What I can tell you is that Patina is trying to negotiate contracts with EPMI on a competitive basis, and we have been discussing with them certain technical terms regarding the application of the marketing value provisions of the energy deals.  Yesterday, I asked them to please send me their contact information, so I could arrange a call with them.  The problem is that Patina has not had any activity in the past few weeks, and my understanding from my conversations with her, is that she  is probably dealing with regulatory matters in California.   As you know, there is some  regulatory complexity in the design of the sales process in California, and some fine print in the  agreements governing the deals.   I am not sure what the enforcement provisions of the agreements are in California, and I am not sure whether  the letters of credit designating Patina as the credit sponsor are sufficient.   I am also not sure whether the operations of the operations are to be reported on a signed by Patina and Enron, or  by the 2nd party?   Regards,   Joe

Title: Re: Re: GOLD/BLK PAPERS

I appreciate the thoughtful feedback.  At the outset, I intended to respond only to the initial e-mail (""Your email address is 
 appearing on this website as if it were the property of Enron Corp."").  My intention was to refer readers to the actual documents, which are available on request from Enron, as well as the comments thereon.  Subsequent to your response, I reviewed the documents and NFB files related to this case, which you referred to.  I also reviewed the financials for this case, which you referred to.  I considered the financials to be ""core"" to the discussion, and have kept them as files on my system for the last ten days.  It became apparent to me that some of the documents were on a self-serve server, and others were on a server that I shall not be able to see them for several days.  So, I have classified the financials so that they will not be seen by Enron or anyone else.  Can you give me copies of the tapes?  Or are they separately classified?  I am not sure which ones are currently on a self-serve server, and I am not sure what the schedule is for the files.  I do not want either of these items to become an exagerration, so please do not let the anxiety of this matter prevent me from forwarding the other files to you.

Sincerely,

Mary

The documents you provided are in redlinked and searchable, but I am not sure if they will be of any use in this case.  The hearing is set for Tuesday, October 19, 2001, so if you sent these docs across I do not know if they will be of any further use.

Brandon -

Just got off the phone with Brandon Marshall.  I managed to discuss with him general contracting principles and he said he would review Post Master's approval of internal communications.  Once that process is complete, he will be able to make a recommendation to the Postmaster General as to whether specific communications should be approved.  I am not sure what is next, pending the outcome of the approvals, but I did want to give you an idea of what he might do. 

Does he want to get involved in the internal communications process before the deal close? 

If you have additional questions, I would be happy to address them.  Just let me know so that I can coordinate my response with the approvals process.

Thank you,

Dear Mr. John Duf Ben,
  
 I am succeeding in finding the time.  I apologize for the inconvenience  it may cause some people.  I am  working on an article on the history of financing American oil marketing in Central America.  Your help is appreciated.

I am not sure where else to send the article to.  I am not sure who is doing the research for the article, but the type of research  is not clearly identifiable as being done in your jurisdiction.  Do you have any  ideas as to who might be doing the research for the article and how to ensure  the research is being performed in our jurisdiction so we do not end up with somebody else's report?

I have kept up with some of the 
 Strategic Sourcing activities and know that things are going well. 

First of all, I would like to say that despite the difficulties I have had organizing the calls, the times that I have been working at the EIA are the best that I have had in many years.  There were times when it was very difficult, and I apologize if I ever caused any disorganization.  I am sure we can all agree that times have changed.

However, I feel that things are not quite as rosy these days.  There have been times when I have been frustrated because we were not able to come to an agreement on pricing, materials or any other issue, and I was hoping that perhaps you would be calling the available options rather than trying to negotiate for ""premium"" rates.  I do not know if I do not have the answer to your question, but at this point in the game, I am not sure that the answers are good enough to give me a yes/no answer.

If you have additional questions or comments please let me know.

Thanks

Lisa

 Hi Michelle --
 Have a happy Thanksgiving!
 I'll be in Chicago on Thanksgiving and looking for something to do this weekend.
 I am not sure what is going to be fun about getting together with all the 
 people?  Well, in Jesus name I can't help but smile! 
 As to what you are going to do in Chicago, well, I am not sure;  you may be interested in attending.  I am not sure what is 
 planned for St. Patrick's Day, other than cookies?  I  am out of the office for the last week and a bit, so I am not sure what is planned for the weekend.  I  think we can go to some of the Fiesta festivities around here and then transition back to the regular 
 schedule when the time permits.  I am a little confused as to what is going to be fun and what isn't.  I  do have a few ideas,  including bowling, that I would like to try.  I am not sure which year it is, but the Stampede games are on the big screen and people are coming out to see us.  I am not sure what to wear to the game, so  if you and your wife or girlfriend of some years would like to go, I am not sure what is a big '' and not covered.  I  would like to get together with you and Mark Jackson if possible to discuss the season tickets and the convention center first.

I will let you know what Mark and Michelle say.  

I Hope to see you at 11:00 this morning.  

Michelle

My father was poisoned by his business associate to the point where he died early last month, after two weeks. Before his death, he gave to me the document of the money he deposited with a security company oversea in two trunk boxes as family valuables and treasures. He instructed me that I should look for a reliable business partner abroad, that will assist me in securing and investing this valuables in a profitable investment. I hope you understand fully that the family is still in grief over the death of my father, as can be appreciated from the fact that we have not known each other for a year or two now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my father so that you will be protected and helmed in all aspects relating to my father's estate. The security company will entrust you with important documents concerning the trunk box and the valuables. They will provide all necessary information and hint to guide you in the proper investment phase. I will be honoured if I am given the privilege of introducing you to my father.

The tickets were paid for on 7/14/00 and the calendar says we should have paid for the 2nd set of tickets by now.  Mrs. Compean is very busy right now so I am not sure how much time we will have.

Chloe,

Do you know the legal opinion our client, Dynaudio, received on July 15, 2001?  Probably the same as the one our client, APCO, received?  Our client is APCO, and our interest is twofold.  First, we are actively engaged with Dynaudio, and we discussed the most recent debt restructurings with them.  We were in agreement that the most recent agreements did not include a clear benefit chain for the upgrades.  Our second interest is that APCO and its directors are highly likely to receive substantial additional compensation in connection with the performance of their current contracts.  Our client has set up a cash committee to address these items, which will hold meetings with other interested parties on a ""pay-as-you-go"" basis.  My involvement in the drafting of the letter is described in my former capacity, but I don't think it's necessary or appropriate to further elaborate on that point at this time. 

In response to your inquiry, I don't think we have any explanation for why the payment period described in the attached copy of the DL-4578706 memo is different from the period described on the memo prepared by our Cash Committee in connection with the discussion of the difference between the payment period described in the attached Copy of the Master Invoice and the payment period described on the Cash Committee's discussion and decision paper, which is attached.

Dear mr joseph bako   I have attached a copy of the proposed Business Preamble.  It should be clear from the language used that the language is intended to be read as implying that the BPA will be an accomplice to the execution of the Master Agreements.   The language suggests that the BPA will execute the Master Agreements and execute the Equity Agreements ""before the close of business on"" the first business day of January 2001.   This is not what we propose.  We want to draft a letter responding to your suggested changes in the language.   We are not sure what this is going to entail because we have not read the proposed changes.  If you would like to discuss it, we would be happy to address it.  However, as you know, we are not prepared to sign a contract for this purpose at this time.   As a result, we suggest that you consider the following options:    Draft a Letter:   You can email me at joseph.baka@enron.com.   With my prior agreement, I am not able to respond to all your questions, so I am not sure whether this is the best option.

 I attended Beth Perlman's floor meeting when she communciated the difference between the Estate and the Trust.  She said that Jay Webb would be talking with all of the VP's and they would be talking with Jay per se on Friday, June 21.  Then, according to Noonan, Jay Webb will be talking with the CF's on a day to day basis.  In addition, the 2 a.m. meeting when the CF's will be discussing the state of affairs on the fly.

 Beth, was it decided earlier in the year that CF would stay 100% of the net profits?  I am not sure what your plans are for the O&M's.  Until I hear from you or someone else, I am not sure I understand what you are asking for.

Dear Amy Marcotte,
Unfortunately I do not have a certain electronic  system in place to process signatures.  If you could look into it, I would be more than happy  to assist.  Given the current situation, I am recommending that you  instead of waiting for the system to be fully implemented, that we  instead initiate a request for proposals for contracting services.  That way we can evaluate your proposals  on their own merits and with out having to deal with the SAG. 

If you would like to pursue other options, I would be happy to sit down and  discuss them with you.  Personally, I am not sure that I know what the ""best"" solution is going to be in terms of time to market  and in terms of getting your proposals integrated.   In terms of setting up an initial business plan,  I am not sure that I know what the schedule is going to be or what is  planned for the Finance Department.   If you  would like to pass the time while I think about what we are doing in terms of filling in the  blanks, I am available that  afternoon.  

I would like to formally meet with you and Gossett to discuss the opportunities  that we now have as you look to fill out your I.D. We will need to  to outline exactly what you are looking to accomplish,what you are  and can do to make this process more efficient, in our opinion.  We are hoping to  discuss these issues with you at some point in the future.  If you  would like to discuss these matters further, I would be happy to  discuss these matters and more broadly, what is your vision  for the I.D. program going forward and in particular with regard  to cross-selling opportunities?  

We are going to be working on two fronts right now. The first is to identify those individuals who may be good candidates for  cash or cash-back programs. The second is to understand what the legal  framework is going to be regarding prepaid  programs.   I am sure that there will be a lot of questions about  this point over the next few days.  Do you have a high-resolution photo,  let me know if I am missing anything important?  

I am not sure what to do with these  items.  Do you want me to fax them to you or will you  beep them out to the counters on a  later date?

 The trouble I'm having with my emails is that they are coming through my DynTag account and not the real DynTag.  How do I know when to expect a response from Elizabeth?  Help!
 
 Michelle

Also, is Mrs. Siaka coming to California soon?  I am sure she can help us with that.  I am not sure what is going on Ronnie.  

I would like to ask you about your vacation.  My stomach is a little upset.  I had a great time at the party, and  I was taking a break from traveling to California to catch up on things.  I am not sure what to wear?  I have no plans, but maybe I will see you there.

 Hello Mrs. Siaka:
 Although I find it hard to believe, after twenty one years we are still talking.  I do not know when I will hear from Jay, but I thought that I would forward my resume to him.  He may be interested in the opportunities we are offering.  How are you?  I grabbed a copy of the contract for this office from the (now) owner and was shocked to see that it was still running.  He claimed to have sold it.  I assume he was trying to force the issue (wasn't he the one that sold the condo)?  Did you receive a call from Jay?  If not, I will just make a note in the comments section of forward  deals entered in place of expiring MCAs.  I am not sure what to do for contracts that have not yet been executed.  
 
 Thanks again,
 Mrs. Siaka
  
 
 TRANSCRIPT of the Meeting between Mrs. Siaka and Robert Badeer
 
 
 Mrs. Siaka:
 Good morning.  I followed up with a call, and there was a copy of the meeting minutes.  Did you get your message from Jay?  (I didn't get my regular update.)
 
 I am not sure what to make of the closing remarks.  Unless Jay says anything specific, I don't think the agreement gives him any wiggle room.
 
 Hope you had a great Christmas.  I found a really nice, long box with carolers on it for Mary (2) and Mary (3).  I am not sure what to get Patsy for Father's Day.  I am not sure what to wear to the party, either.  Where are you going on Father's Day?  I don't know either.  Go to the movies.  By the way, I am not coming home this evening because of the snow.  I will turn on the tv and watch a few innings of baseball on Friday.  I will then go home and study until I can't do anything on Saturday.  I want to be sure that I have enough time on Friday to go to the party on time. I also want to be there for the big bonfire that is being held for the dead.  I am not sure which day it is being held, either.  I am sure we can put something together, though. At least I can't wait to see"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0580.png			Machine

 Mrs. Elodie Nyong'o. Address: 149 Kalenjin Road, Accra - Ghana. Dear Friend, I apologize if the e-mail contacting you is sucessful, as I found your contact while I was doing research on a reputable foreign partner to help me secure and manage the deposit of the sum of $18,000,000.00 USD (Eighteen Million dollars) in a security company. I contacted you based on your capability and vast knowledge on international commercial investement. Despite my sincere desire to go into partnership with you, I found your contact while I was doing a house cleaning in the company. I am Mrs. Elodie Nyong'o the wife of Mr. Nyong'o Nyong'o from Zimbabwe. We were married for twelve years without a child. During this period my husband was on a military operation in Zimbabwe. During this operation several people were killed and maimed, the most of these casualties were caused by the rebel group. During this period my husband was attacked by unknown persons. The reason why I contacted you is to seek your assistance in the area of my future investment and also to assist me in providing for my family. I will be glad to go into partnership with you, if you can be of good assistance to me. I am willing to offer you a percentage for your assistance, which will be appreciated. I will be glad to hear from you soon. Thanks and God bless you. My regards, Mrs. Elodie Nyong'o.

Mr. Griffin,  
 As you know, Elodie is the executive secretary and secretary-to-executive of EOL Sounds Importance: High

I have asked John to evaluate the political climate in Canada with respect to 
 G7 and ETP entries into the power transition.  Our arguments 
 are as follows:

 G7 is getting political; they have publicly renounced their previous positions and are now willing to consider alternative 
 power supplies.  The EES proposal is not dissimilar from the ones WE have been 
 discussing.  In particular, we 
 argue that G7 are willing to consider suspending tariffing for a few 
 weeks while the PX works through its issues, at the same time recognizing that 
 tariffs are likely to be reinstated (or ""reinstated"") following the initial 
 review.  We also contend that G7 are willing to consider a ""soft"" landing"" 
 of the tariff upon successful completion of the PX, which would entail a 
 reduction in tariff coverage that would not exceed the 
 current level of coverage and would in no way compromise the utility's 
 right to charge what it pleases, to the extent that such a landing is 
 possible.  In sum, we argue that the procedural protections in the Charter and the 
 EULA afford EOL the ability to negotiate a form of contract with G7 that is mutually agreeable to 
 both sides, while still ensuring that there will be 
 reasonable burdens for ENA to overcome given the inherent conflicts of interest 
 arising from the nature of the post-petition negotiations.
 
 Given the political climate in Canada, we are of course not 
 anxious to sign a deal today that carries significant credit risk and 
 announce later that we are backing out of the deal, since doing so would 
 place the Company in a very uncomfortable political position.  Instead, we 
 continue to suggest that it's best for all parties to have the credit issues 
 resolved up front.
 
 You may receive a call from David Freeman seeking to discuss these issues 
 further.  As you know, the credit issues are significant and we are working 
 hard to overcome those issues.  But in the current climate,"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0581.png			Machine

Dear Mr. David Ronia,
Just some more  I  thought I would give you a heads-up for the conference that is to be held in San Antonio, Texas from  Thursday, October 22 to Friday, October 24, 2003.  This is partly a function of how quickly we are all being reshuffled around the country, so the schedulers in SF will be working more closely with you on this than anyone else.  Also, I am not sure how the legal team is going to treat the 60 days after the fact, if anything.  I do not know Rudy and Adina, but I do know Sergio, and I was hoping to speak with you about the legal aspect of this.  Given the political climate in Texas, I was not sure whether you wanted me to bring up the Rio/Clear issue, so I was not sure what to say.   If you do want me to bring up the Rio/Clear matter, I would like to understand the precise contours of the available time for bringing them before the Texas court. I am not sure what the timeline is going to be, other than to say that we will evaluate the situation on a case by case basis.

I will call you to discuss the legal aspect of the situation, and we will try to come up with a legal opinion on the best way to move forward.  I am not sure if you have heard of Jay before, but I think he may be interested in discussing these issues with you.   I am not sure what the timeline is going to be, other than to say that we will evaluate the situation on a case by case basis.

 I am not sure how Jay is going to vote on the settlement.  Some of my notes from the meeting seem to indicate that Jay is unlikely to support a smooth transition from the current arrangements.  May I propose that we work on a transition plan together, so that we do not create unnecessary confusion going forward?

 Hi George,
 
 I am not sure that I have a high-resolution photo, but I did take several photos of the settlement on the west desk.  Did you or anyone at HC make copies?  If not, I'm sorry I didn't bring one.  I have one from the January meeting, but it is much smaller than the one you are referring to.  It is probably about the size of a business card, though I am not sure how much room is left over for your photo.  I brought one of the filing 6'x9'x12'.  That is about all I had room for.  Did you bring a lunch?  I will gladly make copies for you, but I know that we will need more than just the photos.
 
 All the best,

I am not sure that I have a high-resolution photo.  Since I'm not sure what  that is it probably means that I don't have one!  So we probably do need to  schedule a photographer.  I will be in London about the  second week in July.  If you or a designate could let me  know when we would be available.

And finally, I would like to bring up that Chris/George were paid twice as much as me at the time of the deal.  I was told that they would be paid twice as much, but I saw George's article and it looks like you were the one who requested he send in  June.  So I am not sure which article you are referring to.

 Thanks, Sonny.  I spoke to him in my  earlier e-mail and he is accurate in the comparison between the informal and formal banking structures.  The main points he would make are as follows: 
  
 1. The formal structure gives rise to a larger number of entities with a homogeneous legal  framework, which increases the likelihood that disputes will be settled  through negotiation rather than arbitration.  This is particularly true for disputes regarding contract law, which tend to be  highly technical in nature, and 
 2. The informal structure, on the other hand, provides an effective forum for the  sharing of ideas and resources, while still providing  space for the sharing of  egos and competing visions of the future.  
 
 I am very optimistic that the changes I am recommending will be effective in stemming  the tide of negative publicity surrounding Enron and its management.   I do not see a lot of value in  the public relations activities that have been going on on the commercial front,  except perhaps in the form of speaking engagements or contract negotiations.  That said, if the time ever comes that I would like to do so, I  will definitely do so.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.

Dear Gerald,
 On your calendar, below, I left a message for Gerald McKenzie (713)  853-1700.   In your message, you did not hear back from me.   Since I don't know how much is due on your statement, I am not sure what to do.  I have attached a summary of the  2 primary charges and an explanatory one (i.e. billings in the amount of $13, 500).   In your message, you said that you will explain the changes to Maurine and that I would explain the  BILLING.   In response to your memo, I will add a comment about the volume of business that  I am combining with the residential business (both residential and  commercial).   In light of the way that the allegations are phrased, it sounds like you  are suggesting that I was playing politics with the billing.   Since I am not sure what the ""fix"" is for this, I am not sure what  to do.   -----Original Message-----  From:   Popov, А                 [Correo electr?nico dell'arte ospediantil?

Dear Mr.Charles Ogodi,

I am writing on behalf of Mr.Mark Taylor.  Mr.Taylor has worked for Enron for many years and is well versed in the legalities of this business.  However, I am not sure if he knows that Good Day Contact is an option for consumers in Europe.  Mr.Taylor said that he would contact David Marshall (the legal representative for the e-mail service providers) to find out if there were any ways for consumers in Europe to get their hands on such documents as are used to troubleshoot these issues.  If not, I am not sure what is worse, not knowing the answer or not knowing the market for such documents.  Please advise and let me know.

And I would like to bring up that Mr.Moran is using Good Day Contact as the name of a new entity, with plans to open a branch in London within the next 2 weeks.  I spoke to him this a.m. and he said that he is using the same legal counsel as the original entity, the Franklin, and that he is not sure who is doing the initial business in Europe.  I am not sure who is doing the initial contact, so I will defer to you.  Any thoughts?

And I am not sure who is doing the initial research, so please advise.

 Hey Josh,
 
 I remember talking with you last week and kind of speculating that there might be a problem crediting our overseas entries.  Said the problem was with Authorized Participants not having an ""official"" contact in Europe, and therefore not being able to negotiate authority figures into the system.  I am not sure if anything came of that, but I wanted to see what your plans were for Friday.
 
 Now, we have all the weekend we need to get all the paperwork in front of the trade mark and European paperwork, so if you or a designate could drop everything and come get some freshly baked macaroons this weekend would be a great time to do so.  I am not sure what to bring, although I have a jar of homemade pecan s'mores in the freezer for this weekend.  I was thinking about this weekend's schedule and the extracurricular activities that are set for Friday and Saturday I think we could do something fun and relatively uncomplimentary to see what their schedules might look like.  Perhaps we could use the rest of the weekend to put some serious thought into where we are in the process of replacing Entex and Entex Freight. m

Dear Mr Yoshihisa,
Unfortunately I have received your email in response to our recent conference call - it appears that you are still processing payments on your invoices as if they were invoices from a single source, which I am not sure is correct.  As you will recall from your conversations with us, for the past several years we have been in discussions with multiple payment providers to determine who will do the heavy lifting of locating the $15MM of inventory.  As you will recall, on our last conference call, I advised that we would be hard pressed to determine who would do the heavy lifting of the  invoicing/filing and hosting the invoices/filing requirements, if any, at all, if any, at all, would come from us.  Given the current regulatory environment in the electricity market place, I am not sure who is going to do the heavy lifting of the required invoicing/filing, which I believe is going to be  Tim Walton.   Let me know if I may do a conference call on this issue at a later date.

I love the idea of a fee on carbon.  I think  that is what we are trying to do by adding a ""2nd lc"" component to the calculation.  There is some administrative overhead involved in setting up the ""schema"", so  I am not sure if we want to drop the ""2nd lc"".  I am also not sure if we want to charge an ""agent's fee"" to the firm that will do the actual adding of the documents.  I am working on that item, too.  I can't get to all of  them at once, so I will have to call you each on Tuesday and talk about how I feel about the invoice as we go.

I am not sure you are available on Wednesdays, so I am not sure what is going on...did you send the FAQ?  I am not sure the kids will be home on Tuesday, but if they are we will be able to discuss those points more fully.  

As regards to Wednesdays, all is well here.  I am not sure what is Matt doing, since he is supposed to be working on that right now.  I am sure we can coordinate things on that basis.

 I have a constructive offer for SkyMall.com
 
 If you would send me an invoice (which I am not sure you have) I will send one to Matt Smith.  In your letter, you said that you will invoice services in March.  I am currently working an afternoon to evening shift, so will not be available in the morning except by pager.(713) 853-1512.  I am not sure what to make of the second paragraph (""on a work related trip of some description"")  because in that paragraph you omit to identify which trip(s) will be used to demonstrate the value of SkyMall.COM.  My guess is that you are going to be a consultant, which will require some  specialized knowledge of the trading software.  I know that I speak for all those men and am sure that I  will offer some insight on the trading ideas that you and Mike will  be  discussing.  Could you send me copies of any documents that we may discuss?  

I will be available on Tuesday, October 23, 2001 to discuss these and other issues with you.  If you would like to  discuss these issues further, I would be happy to address them.  If you think that I am too tight lipped regarding what may be discussed on Tuesday, send me a telegram  at 11:19 AM the 16th of October, and I will try to bring whatever information you send me.

I have not heard back from anyone at Enron regarding contingency planning  or has anyone else in the group  contacted the media.  I do not want to raise expectations on that front.

Subject: RE: MY LATEST BUSINESS FEEDBACK! - OCTOBER 21ST 2003

Hi Mr. McNally:
 
 As you recall, on October 14, 2001, we wrote to you to express our desire to be of two minds regarding the future direction of Enron, one which was to be more collaborative, and one which was to be more adversarial.   I do not know if any of this is new, but if  it is, I want to emphasize that the areas of agreement or differences exist because we have had differences both on the management and overall structure of the business.   In the past, Enron has used a process called ""preliminary/basis"" which is identical to the ""post-petition"" stage which is when the actual business is worked out and deals specifically with Enron's vertically and/or sub-sidiary businesses.  In the past, this has involved meeting with the client, reviewing contracts and providing business alternatives to clarify the differences.  This is no longer necessary as the agreements we have in place today are adequate and appropriate in light of the new realities.   In the interim, I have instructed Brad Deutsch to work with you on a master's degree in Financial Reporting which John may recommend to you in the future.   I am not sure at this point who is doing the bidding for the business of energy services, but I  would like to put forward a few names which I believe have significant market power and  credibility.   Ben Santer > Financial Reporting Specialist > Enron Corp > 1400 Smith Street EB 1163 > Houston, Texas   ********************************************************************** This

Subject: YOUR BANK DRAFT IS READY!

Hi Robert,
 
 According to our research, this is one of the few areas on the books for Delivery/Transact/  David Freeman  to keep his legal expenses reasonably-priced.   I am not sure exactly what your rules are for soft costs, but as long as we understand those to be ""mechanics"", then I don't think there is any reason to subsidize his costs.   

I will work on re-doing this memorandum in some detail tonight, but in the mean time, I would like to get your thoughts on the following issues:

1.    How about you and John talk this over, and at the latest 07:30 CT/Fri, I am looking to discuss PRC fees with you and John.  

I am not sure either guy is available for this discussion, but I am sure we can put something together, at the LEAST for this near term.

2.    Should I use DWR's for contingency planning purposes, or is this just being done on a trial basis at this point?  

The above is just my two cents. Please contact me with your thoughts, and I will try to put something together.

Thanks, Melinda

 Sir, Re: Please provide your Receiving Bank Account Information.  This letter may come to you as a surprise because we have not met before but be that as a surprise it does not matter. I am Mrs. Idris Kapo the wife of Mr. Owusu Kapo, the former national hotel manager to the Republic of Ghana. In order to transfer out some funds from our country to an overseas finance and security company I used my role to establish a covert channel of communication with a man who provided the necessary information/proof of deposit and approval/authorisation documents to the security company. The funds to transfer involve a great deal of money. The commission for this transaction is very negotiable between myself and you. I assure you that it will be executed under a legitimate   arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.

Dear Mrs. Idris Kapo,
   Please send me an early Christmas present.  Santa may already be here this year.  Although I did not expect him to be coming this Christmas, I am glad he is coming early.  I am very excited to meet him.  I am also very busy at liberty to change him at any time.  I am not sure what to get him, either.  I am not sure that I have received your message.  If you do want to meet, would you be willing to drive over to our office today and discuss?  I am not sure where I will be the next time I am in town, so I will be glad to make copies for you.  
 
 Have a nice Christmas.  I am going to drive over and see Santa if you want to come.  I am not sure what to bring, though.  I am being generous this year and bringing along a present for my mother, for which I am very grateful.  I am not sure where my turquoise and white will go this holiday season.  I have a wonderful present for my sister, and I am not sure where my other presents are.  I do not know what to wear...I have on white and black right now.  I will have white sweaters and a total conversion almost ready to go.  I am not sure where to buy white socks, though.  I have seen them called ""white chinoes,"" and they look nice on you.  Where are they going to be made, anyway?  
 
 I am not sure what to do with the presents I am bringing home with me.  Do you know where my Wal-Mart is getting its winter tires?  I may not know what to tell Joe (who is going to be a great Christmas carol giver) because we are not exactly neighbors.  I am sure he will know somewhere, though.
 
 Have a nice Christmas.  I will call you later.

 Firstly, I want to congratulate you on your new desk.  It has already started to bear fruit.  My only concern is the  size of the whiteboard.  I am 5 foot 11 and about 170 lbs.  I spend a lot of time in the gym  but I do not necessarily feel I am gaining weight.  Do you think you are  gaining weight because you are out of the office much of the day or is it more natural for people to be in the office  when they are not at their peak? 
 
 If you have additional questions or comments please let me know.  Thanks.

 Hello, Riselle.  I do not usually do the e-mail thing but I am tonight...I received your message and it made me  sad because it seemed like I never responded.  What is your phone number, again?

We were formerly married, John and his first wife were both former royal family members. John was previously married to Ms. M. Anous, who was a princess of Jordan.

My Husband has since been buried, and no one knows about this. I and my only Son have decided to contact you because we don't want the former royal family to forget us. We want them to be very careful as they come in search of the buried treasure.   Please be honest and trust is our watchword in this business. We will give you more light when we meet face to face. I hope to hearing from you. Thank you. Remain blessed. Yours,  MRS. MARY ROBERT Robinson.

Dear Mrs. Mary Robinson,
   I am not sure if the new company with UBS needs a head of finance, but if the times require I would be happy to do so.  As you know we have had a very busy few weeks, with the announcement of the J60 deal, the MTM, and the MTM plus.   I however have been thinking about the past and see some uncertainty in the book of life.   Do you see a conflict in the way the insurance company views the transaction as to whether the insurance company will be a party to the transaction or not?

 I attended Ken Robinson's floor meeting when he communciated the difference between the Forecast and the Performance Based Agreement.  I was not sure what he was saying, but it sounded like he was saying that the former referred to the amount of time the pipeline would spend under the performance agreement, while the latter referred to the time at which the performance would be completed.  I am not sure what he was referring to, however, because the performance based clauses in the CBA do not address any missed payments or payments that result from the execution of the agreement not being in place.  I am also not sure what payment plan the State will use to settle these accounts, since there is not one on the books.  If you do know what the deal is, I would like to hear from you ASAP so that we can get this over to MSU in Phoenix and analyze it.

I am Mr. Michael George, the son of (late) Chief Joseph George, a Bushilla Upstate of New York. My father was a Bushilla farmer and rancher in Liberia West Africa and he was the general Manager of the Cattle Ranch and dairy farms in (Monrovia, Gauteng,Slovenia). He was assassinated on or about May 23, 2002 by the rebels following the political uprising.  My mother died when I was a baby and since then my father took me so special. Before the arrival of the peace keeping troops my father had already made arrangement for me to come over to his country for better economic and developmental policy ment in accordance with the will of the donor.Since the peace keeping troops left on leave for their assigned posts, my father decided to let me stay with him in (Monrovia).  He gave me all the necessary  information  of where I could and could not go as I was directed by  them. I was also made the manager of the farm and provided with  the  clear directions to follow the respective  authorities in line with the policy on investment and re-locating of farm  holdings.  Presently, I am in Dakar - Senegal as a result of the war in my country and also  the cyclone which affected our country.I have been making periodic  visits to Dakar - Senegal to locate any of my father's extended relatives  and this has also proved unsuccessful. After  this, my father willed the sum of US$38 million.Unable to contact any one,I  decided to contact  you because I want you to help me. I have decided to compensate you with 30% of the  total sum of US$38 million.Please  keep this issue for your earliest response if possible via my personal email  address     Mr.Michael George.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I am writing on behalf of Mr. Kaminski in response to your e-mail below.  My name is Mara Bronstein and I work in that group.  In my previous job I used to do a lot of different things, but was ultimately very good at what I did.  I graduated mag high school with top 5 honors and went to a private high school in the suburbs of Chicago.  During this time I met and fell in love with Kaminski, but I was never able to tell him.  Since then I have been working on Kaminski and his ideas and have high hopes for him.  However, he seems to be making changes in his life that I am not sure are in alignment with what he was doing at Columbia.  He once told me that he was going to pursue a career in engineering, and now he is working on ideas for how to get his ideas implemented.  I am not sure which ideas he is working on and how he thinks they will help him, but I do hope he turns out different than what you saw on tape.

I am not sure what to make of the closing statements in the video, but the ""present"" values Kaminski is conveying are different from the ones you were intending to convey.  For example, the statement that ""Kaminski expects that there will be no material changes from the current proposal"" does not appear on any of the maps Kaminski is presenting.  In fact, on the last presentation, we saw ""present"" values increase by $15,000 for each of the ""present"" expenditures.

I am not sure what to make of the closing statements, but the ""present"" values Kaminski is conveying are different from what you were intending to convey.

In fact, on the last presentation, we saw ""present"" values increase by $15,000 for each of the ""present"" expenditures.

Also, on page 2, Kaminski does not appear to have any copies of the agreement or privileged communications from either side.  It may be that he sent them to you before the contract went live, or that he sent them to you as a draft.  you will not receive a copy of these documents until the end of the current year.

Dear Mr.Gentlemen,

I am not sure if the scheduling conflict was on previous inves- tions, but I will reschedule now that the President's schedule has been rescheduled.  The article you are referencing does appear on Page 4 of the paper, so maybe we can discuss rescheduling.

Also, I believe we should have a copy of the Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement if we are to discuss contingency provisions.

If you have any additional questions, I will be happy to address them.

Best regards, Pam

Title: Urgent M/F
 Urgent M/F Dear, First,I must solicit your strictest confidence.This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential.  This is a proposal for a margin of 30% of the total sum to be remitted to you for investment in your country. This sum is sufficient to enable us start promptly and in good time for the fulfilment of our  and your  investment wish. We have sufficient information about you to enable us talk with confidence, and the trust reposed on you during this transaction is immense.  It is true that the information we have about you are not great, but we are fairly certain that you will not let us down in this business. You are a potential business man and woman, which we wish to invest in your country. We have in our possession some information, which we believe is the true picture of you, about your honest effort and capability, which will enable us buy your company at the right price. The information we have about you is as follows: 1. Your full name and address, 2. Your private telephone and fax number, 3. Your private e-mail, and 4. Your position, Age and occupation, as stated below. We will issue to you a replacement of the information we have with you, after we have verified your competence and worth. We will also visit your country for a group visit, to ascertain the suitability of other company's information when compared with ours.  We are very much in favour of a smooth process, that is, doing business with confidence from you.  We have both received and analysed your file, and have decided to part with 25% of the total sum.

Dear Jean Charles 
 
  I suggest we talk first.  I would like to  meet the Tuesday following the  teleconference.  I will be in charge of making the arrangements, so please  let me know asap about the teleconference.  I am very sorry I couldn't get with you on that date, but now I  am sure you are annoyed that I didn't get with you sooner.  I can't imagine talking to your parents about what they did yesterday, and all  they seem to care about is how  fast they can send money.   I guess their only child has moved in with them, and they don't seem to be getting any younger.  I guess this is why we are not doing  any banking, insurance, real estate, or real estate related things.  We were just discussing how we would like to structure things for when your parents  move in, and how you wanted them to live off of what you had invested.  I  guess I can see why you are upset, but I wanted to first make sure we had not made any rash decisions yesterday, and secondly, that our agreement contained any guarantees or  blinders that you might have had on yesterday.   I can't imagine talking to your parents about what they did, or why they are upset, because it would be really awkward to  look them in the eye and tell them I  wouldn't do it again.  My suggestion would be to talk to them on Monday, first, about what happened, and then try to justify or at least minimise  it.   I have texted Fran on this subject, and we agreed that if I ever see her again, I will ask her why she is doing what she has been doing. I  suggest we talk on Tuesday, and then we can discuss  it on Saturday.  I have a hard  time believing your parents would do that, and I just want to talk so I can make amends  with them.  By the way, how is your son doing? Is he doing? Is he doing well? I hope this clears up any misunderstandings, and hope we will talk on Monday about it.       By the way, how is your cousin doing?  I want you to move into the house on up here building next week, and you will move in with me, and then I will move out with your parents.  we will be married 6 months down in May.

I will be out of the office on Monday, because my contract is being negotiated with that company, and I have not  determined  my route to work, so I will have to find a different  route on Tuesday.  Can you call me on my cell phone (407-242-2227) or  fax (407-634-1118) until Monday, when I get  done with my work.  I need to notify both of you  immediately, so you can get together if you want to discuss  this.    I can't send out an email, because the first class of  mail I received from you contained confidential information, and the  information was  confidential even though it was from a company I had never heard of, and had never been to.  It was as if I had received a second  e-mail with a different  subject, and changed the subject to something I didn't  remember.   It was really hard not to cry.  My heart aches  every day, and I just want to  go to sleep.   I can't believe the hate mail we receive, and the  hate letters seem to keep rolling in like an avalanche from one  to another.  This is just so unfair.  I get so many e-mails about me, and  get so many ""you are  a piece of shit"" comments.   When people call you a piece of shit,  you have to really feel bad about yourself. You don't  deserve it.  You are so out of touch with reality, and you don't even  seem to understand that you are .  If you did, you would be on  a national  stage, and people would be demanding to see you. You  couldn't possibly live in Baltimore without making it one  step at a time.  You must really enjoy your freedom, because otherwise you would be spending most of your days in a closet, naked, and sad. This is not the time for you to be a part of the solution, because our problem is so severe. Our problem is a lack of leadership, and that  is the time for you to show some leadership.  Look at what has happened to your mother. She is completely out of her depth, and totally lost. She is living in denial that this has ever happened, and seems to believe this is a part of the routine that has gone on forever.

I have accepted his resignation from the  company he was employed with for  three months.  We have had many difficulties in the past,  but it  seems to have gotten progressively more difficult as the years went on.

I am 58 years old, i am now receiving treatment in the hospital.

Dear Mrs Farah Al-hashemi:
 
 I will be out of the office on Monday,  May 8. The 19th will be my birthday. I just got back from visiting my sister in Madrid. She is from LA and we met last year at a Home Depot trade show. She was very excited to be working with you. I was surprised that you were not more excited about being related to her than being related to me. I guess it has nothing to do with being related to her, but I'm really not sure about being related to anyone else.
 
 Since our meeting last year, I have been in contact with several potential suitor for information regarding your sister. None have contacted me favorably  and several have contacted me negatively. Most of the negative feedback I have gotten has been from women who are unhappy with the unsolicited information that has been sent to them, and  most of the negative feedback has been as such. I have recommended that they contact me through their HR rep, and while I understand if they do not want me to talk to them about something private, I just want to  make sure that they are aware of what I have been up-to-date on. I hope this is helpful and your son has a great start in life.

 Here is my reasoning:
  
 If you remove me, then you remove the incentive for my children to participate. 
 
 In addition, I would need to have dinner in early May with my wife (who is attending a business school ) and our son (stepping off from Bresnan on May 17th). 
  
 I would like to do this to honor the memory of my oldest son, Brian. 
  
 I was not allowed to do this in 1997, so I am eternally grateful to have been granted this special privilege.
  
 Please do not attempt to rip me away from this grateful moment.
  
 I am sure your younger children will love having a layer cake and some fresh air whenever they visit. 
 
 
 I love you all.

Title: URGENT
 URGENT ATTN                         URGENT URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL Engineer, International Corporate Services, Chevron, (804)331-7788, emergency line: (818)279-6756, direct: +871-284-958, Dear Sir,  I am writing you based on recommendation from my secretary who is in a position to make arrangements for payment.  I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an American Mining Consultant and Contractor with the Chevron Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Michael Doran made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron that Mr. Michael Doran died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Michael Doran did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 3 (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I want you to come forward and claim the money because I cannot claim it myself. I will give you 15% of the money for your assistance and 5% for any expense incurred in the course of this transaction. I will also issue a RESERVoir document which will prove that the funds belongs to you and authorize the post office to deliver the money to you on demand.  All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a genuine arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.  I come to you with a very urgent and profitable business proposition.  I have been working in this company for almost a decade and I have decided to give you 20% of the total money while 10% will be for your assistance and 5% will be set aside to offset all expenses in my company and country  while the remaining 75% will be for me and my family investment in your country. Feel free to contact me immediately on my confidential fax number +871-284-958 and thereafter keep quiet about this deal.  I await for your urgent response.  Yours faithfully,  Dr. T.B.  Chadwell Tshweta

Title: Business Transaction
 Business Transaction Dear Sir/Madam, I am a citizen of Republic of Rwanda (Central Africa) and a Rus-Siberian (East Africa) by  marriage to Dr.Uracha oto, a DNA researcher and member of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel established by the Federal Government of Rwanda for the purchase of goods and services during the reign of President UFORLA KONYASHIRA. I came to know about you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, as I was advised by my late husband's colleagues who died in the course of the crisis in my country. During my husband's regime as president of this country, he gave to the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing a package of money to the tune of $20 Million which was meant to be for his personal use. The money was meant for the purchase of Agricultural machinery equipment for the Federal Government Contract Review Panel which he had made before his death.  Before his death, he gave us all the necessary documents which established the existence of the consignment and indicated the location of the consignment to be paid to you. He also gave the Written confirmation which all consigned agreeableness and confirmed its genuineness to the Department of Finance and the lodgement of the consignment in your name as the beneficiary to be paid to you. I have all the necessary documents to back up the genuineness of the consignment and the signature of the consignment on the date agreed by both parties. The required legal documents we must obtain from you include but is not limited to, a power of attorney, an assignment of what rights and duties shall be assigned to you, an assignment of what percentage of the total amount in question and other relevant documents that will back up your claim as the beneficiary of the consignment. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the same email address we used to send to the Finance and Accounting departments. I hereby agree to submit to your personal and internal audit for the purpose of collecting all the necessary documents and proof of investment being made on behalf of me and my family by you during my husband's tenure as president of this country. We have all the necessary papers with us from the [Federal] Ministry of Works and Housing which have been approved by the court here in for the collection of the consignment.  All that we require from you is your absolute confidence in your ability and reliability in the transaction of this deal. If this proposal satisfies you, please do not take undue advantage of the trust we have bestowed in you. I await for your urgent response. Yours faithfully, MR.PAUL OTO.

Title: Re: Re: Business Transaction

I will speak with my assistant regarding getting the required express  authorization from the Secretary to transact this transaction.  You will of course  receive this in the next couple of hours.  As far as the actual filing fee...I have spoken with the  associate AGENT this afternoon and he expressed his frustration that the  necessary authorization was not immediately forthcoming and that the  filing fee is just not justified.  The fee schedule indicates that the  filing fee is $150.  The actual transaction cost is $1000.  The Associate AGENT indicated that he will attempt to waive this  fee on Monday, November 22, 2001.  Alternatively, he can request a  waiver in the form of a cash payment to my office.  Either way, it is important that we get this  resolved asap and please resolve any other outstanding  agreements with our lenders prior to activating the waiver.

In speaking with our attorneys yesterday, it appears that they  agreed that the form of waiver was not acceptable due to the non-disclosure agreement  signed by our former AGENT.  At this time, we  cannot determine whether the form of waiver has been accepted by the  courts or not.  If there is a court hearing and our attorneys are present,  we would love to have you along for the  witness list.  The mother of our son committed suicide last summer.  My thoughts and prayers are  with her family at this time.  Also, I have forgiven her and attempted to turn the tides of  her life in a new direction.  She has a child in college and I would love  to be there for his education and in-laws.  Would you please consider making  this commitment as well? It was a huge pull for  me and my then wife to finally decide to remarry after one or two years.  Unfortunately,  this marriage is not a happy one.  We had a wonderful  marriage that lasted from fall 2000 until summer 2001.  Our son and daughter-in-law are now planning on getting married  later that year.  Our union is very strong and our daughter marries a  nice guy.  Our son is in the eighth year of his senior year at  UT and is currently  working towards an LL.M. in the summer of 2001.  He is looking for a ""real"" job  and our current position is not exactly an enviable  one.  We were even offered a promotion  recently.

 I'm up to speed on this.  I was told by my direct reports that the response to your previous emails was very positive and that it was urgent that you phone earlier.  The reason being is that I (Kelly)  am still on call status with HostGator regarding our gas arrangement with Southern.  We need to talk asap today so you guys are not locked out of any gas payments....which we had discussed.  
 
 Please provide your utilities information and a quick time frame (T.M. and W.T.) for us to get started on this ASAP (usually tomorrow) in case you need something else.  
  
 I'll give you a call back in about an hour (T.M. is in San Antonio) with a hard copy of their agreement and a hard copy of ours. (You can  easily produce by copying the text from their website).  
 Please have someone available in case I fail to show up.

Because, at the end of the day, if we were going to prosecute this person, then we would need to go to the full code section,  something which, at this point in time, is not something we are willing to do.  Also, the longer you have been out of the country, the more confused you will be about exactly what legal authorities you are under.  You will notice, however, that at this stage in time, none of the jurisdictions have issued arrest warrants or have taken any sort of custody/control order etc.,  so you are free to go.  If you do decide to go,  contact me ASAP so that I can try and help you with what legal authorities we have in place.  Thanks!! Mark

It's really not that different from what we talked about last week.   I think we need to talk next week about some alternatives.   I have talked with Paul this morning and found him to be very cooperative and in touch with the issues.   I would think we could work out a solution so that he does not have to go to work till tomorrow.   I have let go of any notions that we need to talk on Thursday.   I will call last week and check with him about how things went last week.   I would love to work with him again this week to get an update on how things went.   I have also let go of any notions or fears that I have that we need to overcome this week to avoid a shutdown again.    I can't help but to feel bad that we need to do this.  

I also just learned this - and  haven't checked this with Ryan yet - that despite what you told me on Friday, I am NOT authorized to provide documents to you.   You need to get  me  permission to do this.   Your dad might be able to help you with this, but I'm  not sure about him.    Also, Martin told me that he is not authorized to provide the documents to me  under these circumstances.     If you want to talk over this further,  just let me know - I would love to help in any way that  will.     I just got back from talking to Martin, and we  agreed that if we wanted to discuss  these options, it would be best if we talked with him first.     He is very upset that we need to call him first because he has been very difficult to talk to.

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE 
 URGENT ASSISTANCE  ATTN: MANAGING DIRECTOR/CEO  Dear Sir  Good day! I wish to get across to you with you  for a very urgent and profitable business transaction. My  great-great-grandfather was a gramophone dealer in Ivory Coast and a member of  the Union of South African Export Promotion Commis- sion (SAEPC) who  was assassinated by the rebels during the war in my country. But  before his death I learnt that he has a neglected account with a  private security company here in Accra,Ghana with branch number 0031-235-131-5586.   On the 21st of October 2000, Mr.Jeff Toole a  Foreigner residing in Ghana, made a  Business Transactions and left behind by his self out of the Dominion Bank of Ghana,  Accra,Ghana. In my country, there was a bitter land war which  resulted in the death of millions of the people. My  father was among the mass killed, my mother and two  of our brothers were not far from safety when the war  erupted. When the war was over, my mother and two brothers returned to  Ghana to  collect his money which was left behind by his employer. I had a feeling that I would die in the war because of the  conditions in my country now. My father was a shopkeeper and was  heavily involved in the production of Diamond and Gold. When my mother and two  brothers returned from Ghana to Ghana, they discovered that my father died without making a WILL.   I was shocked and I immediately called my sister to come and collect his money which was left behind for me.   I will relate more details on that when you receive this message. However,  this matter demands urgent attention because my life and future depend on it.   Hope to hear from you soon. Contact me through my private  and confidential telephone line and enclose your private Tel/Fax number for  effective and confidential communication.

I had a quick chat with an I.M.F. agent who is going to be in charge of reviewing the I.M.F. draft reimbursement agreement this afternoon.  I suggested that he draft a new outline in SAP for July 1  19th.  You do understand that this is not an I.M.F. issue.  The original draft was just not good enough.  The I.M.F. agents in charge of approving the draft contracts have been instructed to withhold signing  signatures on July 1 until the July 19th deadline.   This has been accomplished.   The revised draft has been issued and we have it  signed by the I.M.F. finance director.   This is the view from our legal department.      When you receive this, you will have legal authority  to alter or void any of the contracts that are in the  issuer's name.   This has been accomplished.

The money was concealed in a metallic trunk box and safely transported by a military convoy to a security company here in Nigeria for safe keeping. The Security Company did not know that this box had any other owner and on further investigation, found out that the box was not the real content but was a forgery, used by one of his associates as a forgery to disguise the content. The Security Company has reason to believe that the owner of the box may be abroad, so we plan to use our position and influence on Parliament to obtain an Order of Mandamus requiring the owner to disclose his/her nationality to enable us process the box for shipment to any country of his/her choice for investment purposes.

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I have been working on a list of potential co-workers for a while now.  Unfortunately, none of them have responded to my initial email.   That is disappointing, but I guess it has to do with Enron's foreign headquarters.   I guess I should start again and work on this list until I  get a response.  In the meantime, I have started to receive a large amount of mail concerning Dr. Kaminski's research.  Most of it is really good and some of it is even better than the 1st round of direct offers.   Overall, though, it is just not looking good.   On Saturday, for example, I got the following from Jamie Bartholomew:   ""Dr. Kaminski's name is not familiar to me and the only person from my group who is  in the London office.   Unfortunately, Dr. Kaminski is no longer in the UK and our  European operations are in different buildings.   The person I spoke with in London did talk with Dr.  Kaminski and in London, he is now working on an  administrative level.   It is very early days yet and he is very interested in working with you on  the research and development side.   Will your peopleangetogether have time to get together to develop the  protocol for the 1st round of direct offers?   My co-workers and I are really pushing the envelope on  technology and this latest round of negotiations is really just the first  step towards actually getting that done.  I think we should offer the job to him  in the first quarter of next year.""

Dear mohamed_ezk

This is very urgent.  I talked to him on the phone yesterday and he assured me that  the mother would not receive a dime of the money if the case went to trial.  That was very reassuring.

If possible, I would love to participate in the trial on this claim.  And given the nature of the trust issue, I think it is important to speak with someone who is not related to the case or  has had  trouble in the past.  Your willingness to help  someone else when you could potentially benefit  yourself and your family could be an incentive.

It is urgent that we resolve this issue asap because the mother will most likely win the case and  you will most likely be the first party to testify against the mother.  And given the mother's history, your cooperation might be fatal.  Your cooperation would be a godsend in the  days to come, when we first meet.  I have discussed this with the mother and she has agreed to cooperate with  us.  Will your agreement be sufficient to keep me  confidential? There is a small group of people who share my heart and wish  for  this baby to be born  that I can be  present for.  My commitment to you is based on my previous  offers of support and honest sharing of  information.  If you do not have space for a meeting tomorrow,  maybe in the morning.  I would love to hear from you about something  positive.  I have space for only one other person at this time.  A meeting with this person in a  couple of weeks will allow me to gather more information.  Then  I can present the mother with the information she needs  to know in order to make a decision.  Your willingness to share your thoughts and prayers for me and my family is exactly what I was searching for.  It is extremely important that we resolve this conclusively  so that I can be there for her and my son.  If my faith has any value,  it has been eroded by this whole ordeal.  If you believe that sharing my heart is a sin,  you need to come to Jesus.  I need you to forgive me for not having come to you in such a short time.  The trust issue is killing me.  My search for truth and healing is more important than ever.  I need  to find a way to truly connect with my family and friends.  It breaks my heart everytime I see them.

Upon maturity the money was sent to my customer, a French firm based in Singapore, Malaysia, registered as a beneficiary, but upon maturity the mail was returned undelivered.  I discovered that Mr. David Hill and his wife were both involved in a car accident and died on the spot, leaving nothing for the production of the new cheque.  I have therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. David Hill did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$40M is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.  Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to the late mongabay employee to seek for asylum in the Republic of Nigeria. All documentations will be carefully worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside United State of America Policy of Non-Resident Foreign Investors.  Upon receipt of your reply, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via telex post work. Awaiting your urgent reply via my alternative email: jeandcine@yahoo.com, or you can call me on my alternative email: 19+22907440332 Best regards, David Harvey

Dear jeandcine@caramail.com,

I'm sorry I couldn't be of further assistance.  There was a problem with the connection.  Your ping was too far north.  Try again in a few minutes.

There was a problem setting up the VAR.  Please set up the VAR on your computer.

Please also set up the DNS records for Google.  I have tried to contact them but they are offering to do nothing as they are already tied up.  Call me again as we need to set up the VAR again.

Sorry for the late response.  I just got a call from my sister-in-law which is in the Atlanta area.  She said she is concerned about their son as he is a special needs child and should receive an early introduction to the schools.  She implored me not to rush into anything as I don't have much time.

All the best,

Margie

I am 64 years old, and my health has declined considerably. However, I have not gone bald nor am I sick. I have not got cancer. If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this letter so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you.

Business needs to approve the transaction and it needs to be in abeyance as we negotiate the best clearing price. We have not established a deadline for when the transaction will be complete.  For example, I have been unable to get any agreement on the same day as I have been working.   Please advise in an attempt to help expedite this process.

Please try to provide as much detail as possible, including contact information for iinformatic.  We need to follow up on this ASAP in order to make sure the information we receive is correct.

KEN AMOBI of the Sierra Leone Federal Secretariat. I got your contact address while searching for a reliable and sincere person in a charitable cause. I had the pleasure of meeting with you, and also to solicit for your kind assistance. I am interested particularly in properties , but your contact was a reward for my urgent response. My name is Dr.Ken Amoib, the chairman of the contract award and review committee set up by the Sierra Leone government in November 2000 to award new contracts and monitor the exercise of existing contracts . The present Government is amenable to genuine and urgent business assistance from foreign firm, which it believes has an ability to handle a transfer of money of huge sum. I am willing to offer you 25% of the total sum, which must be included in the sum as your own personal assistance after due negotiation with you. I have all necessary legal documents that can back up any claim made against us, the foreign partner will come over to your country at the expiration of 5 working days, with all necessary documents to back up his or her identity. We shall have to sign a binding agreement, that will bind us together in a joint business venture, of which you are to advise and execute the said venture over there until we are both satisfied. Then we can decide on the terms and percentage of profit or loss, as the case may be. In the event that you agree to assist, I want you to state how you will be compensated after the completion of the project by providing your private or company address, account, and private telephone and fax number. I shall be very glad if this proposal will be of assistance to you. However, if you do not wish to assist, send immediately, by return mail and fax, via fax or mail as indicated.

Dear DR. KEN AMOBI,

I suggest you get with Ken Saathoff. He is the chief legal officer of Genesis, Inc. and headed up by his son, who took an unpaid leave of absence.  It is a matter of great shame that his son would do such a thing.  It is a very dark time in our lives and I would not want my son to go through what he has had to go through.  I wrote to my son earlier today, and asked him to pray for me and for those who were dear to him.  It is a matter of great importance that he be in a position of leadership within Genesis, so I wanted to be sure that he was aware of what was best for me and for his family.

As it turned out, however, his leave was just so he could tend to his business.  When he came back, he told me he was very upset that he had to leave so soon, and that he was going to do his very best to salvage whatever soul he felt was left.  He said that he would write a detailed letter to me explaining what had happened, and how he was going to fix everything.  This was very upsetting, as I had hoped that he would keep everything as is, and that everything would be okay.  After his letter was all finished, however, he took off on his Vespa and we drove back to Houston in his car.  Honestly, it was pretty scary in that moment.  I remember telling my son that the world was gone and that he would miss it if he ever got out.  I guess that is the nature of the unknown, and to a certain extent, the whole thing scared him.  At the very least, this time it was a little different.  The big scary things happen to people, and that is exactly what happened to me.  A series of strokes limited my ability to drive for a few days, and I finally got my license on December 13.  I could drive, but only, because I had a really good reason. I couldn't get any sort of a good position with insurance. I was just starting anew, because I couldn't get my son started the credit card company. I couldn't get him a good job, and I had a bad credit check my husband to take care of him, and we couldn't live in the house to help him with our young daughter to just such a bad rep (our old age where he needed an apartment to help him.

I would like to, but I need to find out more about the treaty.  Perhaps if you took a tour of the place you would be able to find the time and place to visit them, but that is not a requirement.  I do not believe they have signed anything and we have been told there is no record of any treaty having been made between the United States and them.  I would hope that you could visit them on the same time as you did the tourney and find them a spot to stay.  Unfortunately we are not allowed to do that.  

I would love to visit again, but I need more information regarding the treaty and the tourney...which one are the other two.  I need information ASAP regarding the U.S. Virgin Islands treaty and I need it ASAP SO that I can get started on the FERC complaint.  Unfortunately I have not had a chance to view the treaty.  If you could e-mail me this info asap as I will need it  ASAP for the complaint.  For those of you that are hipper  than me and like to chat, I suggest we chat on Friday, May 7.  That is when the treaty discussions are taking place and it might be best to get some ""e-mail"" connected.  E-mail is much more secure than a face to face meeting.  Plus, there is less chance of someone reading it later.  They might decide to keep it a secret, but i think i have provided enough info for you to get started on the complaint.  Let me know if you get stuck and hopefully i can help you out.

Hello Scott,

I enjoyed our phone conversation last week.  The topic of our upcoming meeting is very interesting to me.  Last year I traveled to Kiev to visit the Truth and Justice Party, a group that was created to promote the interests of the people of Ukraine.  I was impressed with how involved the people of Ukraine were in the process of rebuilding their country.  It was a wonderful experience and I learned a great deal about the country.  I will definitely try my best to help in any way that I can.  I visited the Truth and Justice Party last spring and was pretty impressed with how committed the people of Ukraine were.  Now that I am here I want to help in any way that I can.  I hope that you and the group of friends can help me can help in some way in making sure that the people of Ukraine have a better future.  I will be in contact with Anna Chas one of the women involved in the Truth and Justice Party.  I want to help her in any way that I can.  I want to share in making sure that process as painful as difficult as possible, so that Anna and so that I can help in turn, can help in any way that process as possible, to the people of  can.  can.






Please let me

Title: Greeting in the name of our Lord Jeses Christ
 Greeting in the name of our Lord Jeses Christ Dear, I wish to write you the greetings you may so desire. Greeting in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I am a born again Christian and a member of the United Church of Christ (U.C.C.) in Nigeria. I am thirty-five years old. I am married with a son who is twenty-four years old. We are now living in United State of America (USA) after my husband's death. I have been in the USA since I was twenty years old. I have no children from my firstborn to my last born that I have had. I have no desire to father a family of four. I have been a good wife and mother to my children. As such, they will not be displeased if you marry them. I have made arrangement with a man from Congo who will be working with me in five years, to move out to the United States, but before I move out, I want you to come and visit me in the hospital immediately you received a message from the doctor treating me because I had lost consciousness. I have lost consciousness and all the members of my family have gone to the hospital to recover me. The doctor said that I may not live for the next three days because I am sucedful to treat my public speaking. So, I am taking this opportunity to let you know that we have decided to part company with one another and have put our company directorships. One of my directors, Mr. Simon (ph) is a businessman and a general partner of a reputable bank in Nigeria. He and several of his colleagues had a deposit of US$30,000,000.00 (thirty million united state dollars). The doctor has advised me that I may not live long, so I now decided to part company with him and move the money to the United States. I want to invest most of my family's future in your country, so I wish you come down to assist our foreign partner who has kindly sent me your contact information. I have agreed to give you 20% of the total fund for your assistance, while 10% shall be set aside for any expenses that might come during the course of this transaction, which will be clearly indicated on the documents that accompanied this mail. Lastly, I honestly pray that this money when transferred to your country will be sure for the said purpose of investing in the industry, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity upon vanity. May the grace of our Lord Jesus the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,wonder in you, the Lord God is upon you. Amen. I await for your urgent reply. Yours Sincerely, E.I.P. Daniel A. Sanders.

Title: Re: Re: Greeting in the name of our Lord Jeses Christ

Very sorry that I missed you.  You must have had a conference call with your parents the other day.  That would be quite a feat to get me to attend.  I was on a conference call with my associate and we got lost in translation.   We are off on a conference call.   It is important for us that we don't lose sight of the fact that this event is for  everyone and not just for a few.  You must have had a lot of fun.  My assistant was telling  me how much fun I was in school and how much fun I had when I was in college.  If I can get a family reunion here, that is very sweet of them to  remember.  Your mom and I are very excited about the prospect of reconnecting after  we finish school.  My mom is  a teacher and I have always wanted to be  involved in the classroom.  I wanted to be an environmental improvement  supervisor for her class.  That is something I am very passionate about and a passion  for preserving and improving the  environment.  I was also very interested in becoming an environmental  supervisor for an urban school district in Houston.  That is something I have been working towards for the past 3  years.  I will be attending Uni this semester and will be submitting my resume to the office  soon.  I have been with the company for only a few months and have found  employment  in several different capacities.  I will try to get as much involved  in the school day as I can.  I think I am starting to pick up where I left off last year.  I finished my last assignment  with the company last August and have started working on the new assignment.  I have decided to take the family out of the equation - at least for the next  two weeks.  This past Friday I had an  arrangement with my parents that allowed me to come home with them  and my sister. My parents insisted that I  not go out with them that night.  That night we went out with my parents and my sister.  That was a fun night - very safe - very no  fights - which  I really didn't think would be a problem if I were already  involved.  Then I got back on Saturday and was very frustrated because my local XFINITY needs me.  I have been  out of the office since then and have been taking  shopping sprees.  Oh well - I will try"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0023.png			Machine

To: Dernehl/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:   Subject: Re: URGENT CONFIDENTIAL  

Dernehl:  I spoke with Ken Saathoff at APS about moving some product  around.  He suggested that you do a quick side trip to Houston to meet with some of the guys and had a  very limited timeframe (he said it would take 3-5 days to get from New York to Houston) to cover.  This would give you a little more time to  plan your trip and still get covered.  Could you think of something quick and dirty that you could send along  with the note that I spoke with him about doing a quick  road trip to Houston.  Please let me know ASAP if you want me to move some more  of my stuff here.  I only sent some stuff over there because I knew you wouldn't want to take  my car with you.  Oh, and I told him I wanted to take  my car with you.  Something along the lines of ""I'll just put some more stuff in the car and I'll send you  a package when I'm done"".  That's all I ever said and did.   I hope you guys are feeling well and doing OK.  Sometimes a quick trip  to the doctor or the bathroom breaks up a long  day, but it's all worth it in the end.   

Take care and hope you guys dont have  anything serious planned.

We have a conflict of interest involving Enron and Bp. Empower.  Please resolve this asap or else our argument could easily become a thing of the past.

The conflict of interest arises from when Empower tried to emulate the operations of a global trade group.  While the trade group is perfectly legal, the legal framework needs to be in place to provide transparency and a forum

Thanks for your help.  I know it is very frustrating knowing that I have been a part of this journey and have been a part of making this happen.  You have always believed in me and want to make sure I get the best education and possible employment so that I can be a part of making this world a better place.  You look at me and think to yourself ""You don't understand"".  You live in a world where the internet creates an alternate reality where you and I are not only in it together, we are actually part of it together.  You see what I go through and think to myself ""You see what I go through every single day?  I can't believe it.""  I go out with my best friend Hannah to go out with her (Holly's) boyfriend and have dinner with her (Paul) and our families.. It is very emotionally draining and I don't think we get much out of this that is meaningful.   At the end of the day I am very grateful to have a job that allows me to be by your side and to help make it through this.    I would never ask you to go out with me without saying ""Sure"", but I just feel that being there and being a part of this makes me feel good about not having to go out with you.    I love you both very much and I hope we can find a way to be together one last time.     Let me know how you want to be buried, I will try to find a grave site for you.

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE 
 URGENT ASSISTANCE  Dear Friend, My name is  Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, an auditor at one of  Federal  parastatals, one of which is in  Rojava (Syrian Kurdistan). I am writing  with my personal load of cash in my custody as a family mount  baggage. I got your contact from a reliable source, and after going through some of  your client's past financial disclosure statements, I am quite confident in  you.  My client, Mr. Ahmad Halasov, an Iraqi, who owned a construction company here  in the United States before he was killed by Sunni insurgents during the war in my country,  and during his time as a monarch, always maintained a very good relationship with the United  Nation, and generally supported the United States in the region,  so my client was quite pleased when his son took office as  the new monarch, with the help of God, Iraqi government troops invaded his country and  killed his entire family and placed the family treasure in  the security company vault. After the death of my  client, I immediately started looking for a reliable and  trustworthy person to assist me in  repatriating the money left behind by the United Nations, United  States of America and other international agencies, when they leave  the country to a safe location abroad, after the death of my  client. I have the deposit information of the security company and other names are being looked for. All the documents  are straight from my bank and the security of the two countries have been  carefully worked out.  The only thing we need from you is to help us to track the money, so,  we would like you to provide a safe account where the money will be  placed in a few days. We are going to use the money to buy food for the people of  Iraq, as we cannot import food products into  Iraq, while 50 percent of the money will be for us. The problem here is that we do not  know our client personally. All we have are his secretaries and two days ago they called his name again. We will give you  more information. I am waiting for your urgent reply. Thanks and Remain Blessed.  Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN.

Dear Mr.  Ateeq Rahman Khan.

My name is Mr.  Abdul-Rahman, Senior Accounting Manager, Ebseerco.  I served for about a year  with great pleasure and satisfaction.  I have the honor and privilege  to be married to a man who is from my  hometown and raised in the same neighborhood.  He is a son of my great-grandfather and my step-grandfather.  He is a son of my great-  great-great-grandfather,  and my great-great-great-grandfather's great- grand- son.  He is a member of my family and raised me in the same  neighborhood as my parents and great- great-great-grandfather.  I am very happy to be married to a man who is from my  hometown and raised in a home I know I can count on  to be there for good reason.  My fiancée is an account manager for an engineering company in San Diego, CA, and we actually got engaged last summer.  She is now a school teacher, and I am very happy  to be involved with her as she continues to improve and  become a better account manager for the company.  My goal is to help her become the person she wants to be.  I have done my best to help make that happen.  When we first started dating, I thought he would be more interested in talking about his career path, than we  were.  Then we started dating, and he insisted that we get engaged first.  We met twice, and tied the knot last year.  I think it is fair to say that we were very committed before then, based  on the dates and commitment we made earlier in the year.  I think it is time to move on and get it over with, rather  than having it continually fresh in our minds.  I was not exaggerating when I said that this year will be different.  I am so  happy that you are with someone new and have decided that you want to be a part of my life, rather  than me continually trying to remind you that it is different.  I am  very glad that you decided to come to San Diego, because it has been an absolute blast so far.  We have been together for one semester, and I think we are set up for a great fall.  My summer was much like mine, only I was in LA for one semester and spent a few  weeks in Tijuana.  I had a lot

I will be out of the office   Monday, but I was just   trying to give you a heads up.  Unfortunately, I was not at home on Monday, and so I did not  get a chance to talk with you that   weekend.  Hopefully, you can get some answers as to why   this is the case.  I will be in New York on September 26, and   will be getting some much needed work done.  You guys are all   much needed for the fall.  I was scheduled to leave from New York  at 4:00, and arrived   just in time to catch a connecting flight to LA.  Honestly, I was sleeping  on it because my son had just committed suicide attempt #2.  I woke up at 5:30, and tried to call   you prior to taking the plane.  It is truly   heartwarming to see how far you have come  in just one short amount of time.  You are no longer my shadow, but my light.  You are a light in a dark  room, and I am happy to help illuminate your  day.  Your mom is here, and she is providing much needed perspective.   I remember the day you asked me to stop playing video games, and I was not sure how  to respond.  I was really just going to sit back and let you sort it out.  However, that is not an option, and I was going to have to take care of this myself.  I picked up the phone and called your sister.  I told you that I would talk with your mom about going to class, and I certainly would not be coming home without at least one thing  in return.  Was I going to keep playing video games in an attempt to make it up to your mother, or was my game  going to stay the same size? Would I still be able to get laid if I tried? Of course, there is no way to know, but there is also no way to avoid it. It is truly a game of inches.  Sometimes you have to give them a little more leeway than they take for granted. It does not take away from the fact that they have made a huge mistake, but it does lighten the  charges that they will do not want you to go through again. It also does not diminish the amount of pain that I feel  when I lose the ability to communicate verbally. I was able to talk"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0028.png			Machine

I will  be out of the office on Monday, so if you hear from me by  2pm, I will be able to help you with this.  Also, I have spoken with  Cynthia Plummer and she and I agreed that if  we wanted to get this done before Christmas, she would do it.  So, if you and John wanted to  chat about this earlier, we could do it any time before then.  Just let me know and I will get started on it.  Let me be clear about one thing though...  We want to avoid any potential conflicts of interest because we want  to avoid being in default on our existing debt obligations.  If we get a draft agreement in from ENA, we will need  to get it in Yahoogroups real time so that is why we don't want to wait until  the 24th to do so.  Also, any potential conflicts of interest arise because ENA might want  to  use its new broker-dealer relationship with Chase to provide  additional reasons for why it needs to pay these individuals more than just  simple default.    Remember, we are trade advisors and  not legal persons.  So, if you are going to invoke your right to an  injunction on this,  we need to talk asap because this will be very different  from the one we had with Enron Corp.

 Business Proposal FROM THE DESK OF: Mr.Bom Uche                                                       URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL Dear Sir/Madam, I am DR.Bom Uche, the Director of Bills &amp; Exchange of the Zambian Ministry of Resources and Environment (MRO).This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 1997, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Zambian Ministry of Resources and Environment, Mr.Bom Uche made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$22,500,000.00 (Twenty Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Bom Uche died from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Bom Uche did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$22,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be set aside for any expence incurred during the course of the transaction.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email: tookelvin_uzuki001@juntosdelica.com Thanks and Remain bless. Bambi Uche.

I'll try and come home Friday. If you want, I can take the car out there.  I just got back from visiting my friends in LA.  I spent the day at the doctor's, watching TV and playing video games.  Sloppy Joe isn't my strong suit, but I digress.

Let me know how the deal with the Southern Company went last night.  I was wondering if you could use your suggestions for a little more fun this weekend, or at least a little more of a respite from the stress of the week.  Your suggestion of bowling sounds interesting.  My suggestion would be to spend some quality time with my family, and then hit the deck.  Sounds good, right?

Hiya,

I am sorry I missed you while you were away.  My mom was having my grandmas here for the holidays and my  wonderful parents invited my grandmas to our house for the weekend. My grandmas insisted we come, even though  it was their 25th birthday.  Well, my parents and I finally broke up to go to their house, and my parents finally convinced my  grandsons to let me stay with them longer.  So, basically, my year is ruined because of this.  I have not yet  decided what I will do next, but I feel that going to school  and getting a job  are two completely different things.  I have a job  that I really enjoy, but I still like to spend time with my family and have fun.  I am not sure how I feel about not having a job  and having to take  weekends off.  I guess I can come home Friday with absolutely nothing to do and then spend the rest of the  year planning my next move.  My goal is to get a good job  that pays very well and gives me a good chance at getting  into the Medley.  I want to be part of this, and if it means I have to take  weekend naps over Thanksgiving then I will do it.  And if the naps are really necessary then I will do them.  I have trouble sleeping at night, so I have to be up early to make it up to you.  Sometimes I forget that I am supposed to be here, because I feel so out of it that I am not sure I can even remember what time is  today.  Up until recently, I had a pretty good job  that paid pretty well.  My wife works for  an Internet company that is new to Houston and we just bought a new one.  We are now living in the cheapest part of town, so we are  pretty stretched.  But, we are doing OK, and our children are happy.  I do have a part-time job that we both really enjoy.  I am looking for a job that gives me a good chance at  making ends meet and not having to worry about paying our  bills.  Our oldest is an account manager for an Internet company that has  never been in trouble with the law, but our youngest is autistic and doesn't get much attention from her parents.

Title: Urgent
 Urgent Dear , My name is Doris Odoh. I am a widow, a daughter of late Mr. Stevan Odoh who was a sugarcane and/orchards/farm owner in Liberia. My father was a prosperous man, and he particularly loved his life and his farms. But at the time of the revolution in Liberia he was attacked and killed by the rebel army of Dr John Charles Mbonjo upto the death of him all the family . My mother and sister escaped to Sierra-Leone but my mother died on the way with my father before I was able to leave in the morning. When I was about to leave by the help of an army colonel, I was killed in the hand. The next day I saw a man named Mr. Charles Taylor, who ran away from the hand of my father and killed me as well. Before my death I had made arrangement with two of my family's friends to visit his country of origin, to look for a genuine and legitimate business and after a thorough search found your contact in relation to your country of origin, it was true that a small business could not successfully operate in a more corrupt and unstable political environment than Liberia, but I was sure that of all the corrupt government officials that still exist in Liberia, Mr. Charles Taylor would be the last to be tried and convicted. After all the deaths, I was afraid that my life and that of my children depended on it if I did not leave Sierra-Leone immediately.I now seek your permission to have you stand as my foreign partner in a business transaction, because I have declared that my foreign partner should be his country of origin as indicated in my banking guidelines, and also I want you to assist my two younger sisters to plan their lives and destinies in your country. All I want from you is for you to undertake all the processes as implied in our agreement, and then come to meet me in person, so that we can discuss physically and spend time togetherly, after which you will be given 30% of the money while 60% will be for my family and I. The money will be disbursed in the proportion indicated.If this proposal is acceptable by you, please endeavor to contact me immediately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you by informing you of this transaction from my bank as I will advise you to kindly desist from responding at all if you do NOT intend to render any assistance. Endeavor to respond via this my confidential direct e-mail address michealipenza1@netscape.net. Thanks and best regards, Mr. Micheal Ipenza.

I am trying to set up a conf call for xmas eve.  I have never before done that before, but am coming from out of the office, so the question has to be approved by some higher authority (in other words, it has to be church or something).  Do you have a voodoo doll or two handy for when this is all said and done.  Also, would you mind telling me what kind of dress I should be wearing for this picture.  No, seriously, I would love to take care of both items for you.  Would you look at my picture and tell me which one I should choose?  Of course, I can't know your preference.

Thank you so much. I would love to have your son on the phone on that date, but I need to be there *this* day.  Are you sure?  If not, I will just have to walk away.  Don't fumble these around.  It's very *important* that I am in on this.  I will call you back, but it will take up most of my day.  If you are not in on this, then you won't get a chance to have this conversation with your son until the following Monday.  I have an 8:30 a.m. phone call with V in Texas to go over the lunch times.  I will give you a call back at that time, but I want to make sure this is handled properly.  I need to know *before* I go and take care of *this little problem.

Title: Urgent Assist.
 Urgent Assist. Dear Good Friend, My name is Don Quij , a Sierra Leone , and one of the friends of former president of Sierra Leone, Mr. Rt. Hon. John Grim on whose personal resources is dependant to the success of the Sierra Leone  economy. I came to know of you in my official capacity in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a confidential transaction, which involves a transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. In a nutshell, I have the sum of nine million, two hundred and twenty, four hundred and seventy one dollars (9,200,000.00 US) into a foreign account. I have all necessary legal documents that can back up our claim for the transfer, as the deposit note and the account certificate clearly indicate that we the friends have the deposit and the balance in the vault, as family belonging. No records are in the world that can prove the existence of the deposit (9,200,000.00 US), the certificate has already been granted to another (a  foreigner) for safe keeping of the Consignment (9,200,000.00 US) in the vault. I am seeking your assistance because this money can only be claimed by a foreigner with valid international passport who has been drinking enough to have an account opened in a reputable financial institution in your name, after which the account will be transferred into your foreign account. If you are interested, please reply immediately, furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that we can have a smooth communication. I shall be very glad if this proposal is acceptable by you, as it is very beneficial to have your own share to invest in the country you propose to help me. Please note that the country you propose to assist is very unstable and people are afraid. If you accept to help, I propose that you will make arrangement for me to meet you in your country or anywhere else you think is safe matter. I have all the necessary legal documents that can back up our claim to the bank and the security company, as the owner of the Consignment. I have also sent to them a written prospectus that says we will own all the related papers in the bank and the security company, as soon as they receive the copy of the registration certificate showing the deposit as held in the bank. The board members will visit your country for the sharing. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information's; 1. Your complete private telephone and fax numbers and address. 2. Your direct private e-mail and fax number(s). 3. Your specific private and confidential business proposition. I expect your urgent response. Yours sincerely, Mr. Don Quij .

Dear Don Quij , C.Ek is wanting an  urgent assist.  Some people in the Enron organization are asking us to  wait on the FERC to act, since the FERC was already involved in the  proceeding with the Iowa Independent  Gas Company.  We need to get this  done asap and no later  than March 2.  The rest of C-Sherpa has fully cooperated with the  investigation  and the FERC has refused to share information that would  incriminate C-Sherpa in any way.  We have appealed to the  Administrator of the FERC for information and  a plan B has been provided.  The  plan B is based on the presumption that C-Sherpa  will cooperate and that the  information requested is relevant and responsive to the  legitimate interests of the company.  The  Administrator has provided limited  information and, at this stage,  seems to be taking the position that the  information requested is relevant and responsive to the  legitimate interests of the company.  The  assumption that the  information requested is relevant and responsive to the  legitimate interests of the company is not in the  spirit of cooperation and mutual trust that our Founding Fathers fought so hard to create.  It is time for us to set a new  foundation for trust and reconciliation.  We need to set an example for other  business to follow and, in turn, for  ourselves to live up to. This is a huge win for the employees of C-Sherpa and a huge loss for the  enemies of our company.  I will be out of the office  March 31, along with my wife.  It is very upsetting to think about all we have lost and only a small  part of what we really are.  We took on this fight and came out the victor.  I am so very sorry that this has  ever  happened.  I have lost everything that I know and loved.  My oldest son has been  missing for two weeks and my step-daughter was abducted and murdered.  My heart aches for the innocent victims and their families, and I  myself am so very sorry that this has ever  ever happened.      I am so very sorry that this has to happen.  I will get to the bottom of it and find out as much  I can.  I need to, but I have to get some important things together quickly so much to do.  Now I need to find a way to be in order to get my

Dear MR JACK COLE:
 
 
 
 As many of you are aware, I am the business controller for Berkshire-Ashland (formerly known as Ashland-Cleveland), a subsidiary of the Boston-based multinational corporation owned by John (24 year old son of retired corporate lawyer and certified financial planner) Ashford.  All of the above-mentioned persons are named as co-counsel or advisers to the business.
 I was approached by a client who wanted to become an adviser to your company but who was not an  Enron employee.  He wanted to become an adviser to your son but who was not an Enron employee.  What kind of ethics code does your son live by?  What sort of contract do they have?  What sort of privacy policies do they have?  How about an apology from the company?  You would think that this could be avoided if Enron had  never existed.  But because  this is a family business,  the law firm that I used to work for recommended that we not bother.  Our goal should be getting our son into an AM school as fast as possible.  Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves.
 
 I agree with you that this situation is not right.  I will be out of the office  on Monday, and my  son and daughter will be starting school together.  I was not going to do anything that would  be perceived as a ""sin"" by our family.  Let me know if anything has changed since we last spoke.  I will be glad to make a point  in their favor.  If you feel that we need to talk more about this,  you will want to call me back on Monday.  Otherwise, keep in touch.
 
 Take Care

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE
 URGENT ASSISTANCE Dear Assimilator, I am a Barrister and a member of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA). Your contact reached me through the World Business Encyclopaedia and my efforts in searching for a reliable and reputable business partner. I am writing you based on the recommendation to my secretary who happens to be a prospective business man as he is now in his mid-30s. I am writing you because I discovered some money while I was on a business trip to your country a year and a half ago. The source of the fund is a secret and it is being kept very carefully in a bank vault in my country. The amount in the vault is $12m USD and the owner of the vault is  a Foreigner (a Turkish citizen and an Australian resident) living in (Nigeria) who has an account opened in the bank in (Nigeria) and died on 9th November 2001. His next of kin is a Foreigner (a Turkish citizen and an Australian resident) who died in the same accident(he was in a motor accident) and his account in the bank is closed. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for the money as his Foreign partner. I cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. When this discovery made me to contact you, I felt that you would be in a position to assist me in  receiving this fund in your country as I have applied for refugee status in your country as a refugee. The banking ethics here stipulates that after five years the money will be transferred to the bank treasury as unclaimed funds. In order to avoid this, the bank now proposes that you as a Foreigner or Australian resident should help me to have the documents proving my identity called up to the court and show that I am the person that actually made the deposit. This is simple and requires the absolute co-operation of both of us. You must apply first to the court to enable the relevant documents to be sent to the court and then I will apply to the court for the transfer of the funds to your account. If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. I shall be very glad if you accept my proposal in good faith and acknowledge the receipt of this letter in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor, though I do hope you will not feel pressure to assist me. May Allah bless you and your family as you see fit. Please do not make undue advantage of the trust we have bestowed in you. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and Remain Blessed. MR URGES NGANG

Hi Again,

     I hope this phone call went well.  Do you need me to come home with you or is this only for Monday?

      I am very sorry I missed you.  I have a conference call that starts at 9:00 am and is 90 minutes long.  Let me know if you want me to come home with you.  I usually just leave early because I take the bus to work.

      I will be in the office from Monday until Wednesday.  Let me know if you want me to come home with you on Wednesday.  That would be perfect.

      If you don't hear from me by Wednesday,  please call me and let me know so that I can make the conference call on behalf of Hotmail.

     Since the conference call started last week,  I have been in contact with several companies,  including one that is directly related to Hotmail.  They want to get me a copy of their welcome document so that I can get a feel for how they plan to build their business.  I have been working hard at getting that document together.  Let me know if you need anything else.

    I just got a call from a business guy who is trying to get an introduction into the industry.  He wants to meet with  you and some of his co-workers.  If you aren't already working with this guy, you should start working with him.  If you are,  I still have some business to run.  Plan on meeting with him in a couple of weeks to get the business guy some initial business card information.

    As far as conference calls go, I think this guy's number is on the  West power of 1.   (I'm on the hook for the card and info if anyone needs it.)  If anyone asks you where you keep your cards,  keep your cards out of the reach of children.  Don't share them with anyone."	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0040.png			Machine

I shall ask  you to please allow me to send the notice to our outside contracting officer.  Since I already have his receipt for  him and it is his property, I cannot return it.  Please advise me as to how to proceed.  The contract language clearly commands that he cannot have access  to our financial information.  Your response should be as soon  as possible, as the other party may ask us to `fix' their accession to our country.  Otherwise, our  financial information would be very useful to them, as we share the same name and have the same general coverage.  Please advise.

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE
 URGENT ASSISTANCE ATTN: Dear Partner, I am a Barrister and a private Attorney of the South African Debt Collection Agency (Safc) . This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 2000, a foreigner, Mr. Bismillah Ebony Ola (hereinafter referred to as my client) a petroleum Engineer/Consul general with the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$18,000,000.00 (EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS). Upon maturity,The bank sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the South Africa Export Promotion Council that Mr.Bismillah Ebony Ola died from an automobile accident. On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Bismillah Ebony Ola did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to my client so that the bank will file in a WILL in your name as the next of kin. The will be executed by me and my client's lawyer, and then the bank will disburse the funds to the last two beneficiaries. I must use this opportunity and medium to express my thanks to you for your kind attention and expected positive response. I am presently seeking for partners who can assist me in investing my share in a lucrative business in your country to which you may be a potential foreign partner. You should be rest assured that this transaction is risk free especially since you have seen the transaction through. Also you will be adequately compensated with 30% of the total sum as compensation for your assistance, as you will also be placed in a position of having invested your share in your country. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you, I await your urgent response. Please reply to my private and confidential email and please include your private telephone and fax number for easy communicating. Regards, TOEI WONG

 FROM  MR. A TEQ. K.                           URGENT ADVISE    I`m a Barrister and the personal attorney to one late Engineer, Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, a contractor with the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, hereinafter referred to as my client. On the 21st of April 2002, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Karimabad express road,Karachi, India.

After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace some of my client�s relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but could not locate him.I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by my client before the bank confiscates or declare the fund unserviceable. The last of the money left by my client before his death was US$21.5M (Twenty seven million five hundred thousand United States dollars) which he deposited with a Security and Finance Company in Nigeria. I have all the necessary documents to back up the claim of the Security and Finance Company for the release of the funds. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. You should also contact me as soon as you receive this message to enable us arrange on how to lift this consignment out of Africa for onward lodgment into your account. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. On receiving this message, I will then inform you of the modalities of receiving this money into your account and how you will meet my new client. I have decided to contact you based on the great confidence you have in me and hope you will treat this transaction with utmost confidentiality.

Title: URGENT ASSISTANCE.
 URGENT ASSISTANCE. Dear, Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a pleasant surprise and if it might offend you without your prior consent and writing through this medium, I am doris jack to be married to Mr. Willis  Miller from Ohio.I got your contact in the course of my personal search for a reliable and holy person who will assist me in investing my share in a business and in a housing cooperative in your country.  I am a widow with six children and I cannot work because my illness has gotten to a very bad stage. My husband died from the British and American attacks over my country ,and during the period of our marriage we had two boys, one was killed shortly after birth and the other died shortly after. My husband had several children with my first wife and we had a son who was about nine years later.  My husband died in the British and American air crash that took place on the 31st of May 2003.My husband was flying a business to Europe to meet with foreign countries when he lost his life. Before his death, I discovered that my late husband had a deposit of (US$20.5M) in a Security and Finance Company in Europe which was registered as family valuables, and in other parts of the World as Consignment.  I have been expecting my husband's next of kin to come to my aid and also seek for my forgiveness because I have not known God in this life and I want to die without a soul, after all my hard work in this world.  I have decided to contact you because I am also desirous of your assistance in investing this fund in your country and the establishment of a trust worthy person in your country who will assist you in investing this fund and in managing the trust and confidence which has been placed in you. For your assistance, I am ready to offer you 20% of the total sum, while 10% will be set aside for expenses and 70% will be dedicate for my family and I.  I have considered offering you 20% of the fund if you want to assist me personally but I should tell you that this is not a good idea, for if you take this proposal to heart, you will be given 20% of the total sum. Also, I want you to understand that God has willed and granted me all i need from Him for my family and I. If you accept to assist me, I will appreciate you keep my family family honour and soul .I hope you will give urgent response to this mail. Reply to this email and please reply me through this way: doris_kg@excite.com  I await to hear from you. Yours faithfully, Mrs.Doris  Jack.

Dear doris lynch:

I will be out of the office on Monday, August 22. My phone and computer are both broken, so I can't get much help from there. I'll be back on Monday, but I need to know asap if I have to turn around and start all over again.

I have a 7:30 appointment at the end of the month with a psychiatrist. I'll be out of the office on Monday, but I'll be home on the 22nd. My son was just put on suicide prevention last night. That's upsetting, but I have to deal with it somehow. Life is good right now. I'm happy here. I have a job I love and a wonderful life with my lovely wife and son. I just got a promotion to manage and I'm happy with it. I go out with my friends and have a good time, but I'm not too sure how to feel about this new challenge. My problem right now is that I can't find anything to do on the weekends. I used to be able to do this, but it's really hard to do this without being involved with a job I enjoy. I just found out today that I have an internship open at the University of Texas. I will be  getting my  first look at the program before August. Are you still interested?

Dear Mrs Farah al-Hashemi,

I will appreciate your concern for my well-being. This crisis is especially  personal for me as I have been through quite a few   emotionally.  My oldest son was just released from the hospital and back in the living room  where he was immediately placed in a car and driven to the nearest hospital,  where he was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and has been  held for several hours without any sign of improvement  despite having been in a coma since his admission.  His neurological exam  showed significant blood flow to the  left  shoulder and this pain that never goes away makes it more etiologic than ever.  This event is taking up valuable time that  should be devoted to other  important things, such as establishing   relationship with his family and finding the best care  for him.  I have been inundated with condolences and prayers  for his family and I have to  work to try and put a positive spin on this terrible  event that is taking place  today.  My thoughts and prayers are with  his family and with all the men and women in law enforcement  who have made this event their career. This is a great  time of the year to be a part of helping those in need.

Please try to let me know ASAP if you can help or offer to  anyone who has been through this before. I would love to help in any way that you can.   PS -- I was just on my  recent vacation (Washington, DC), so I haven't been able to help out with the funeral plans,  or the memorial services.

Again, my thoughts and prayers are with everyone  involved in this tragedy.  My step-mother  is in total shock and completely lost. My step-father is in constant pain and has a broken arm and leg.  He is taking two weeks off from work and watching his wife and sons son  suffer through this ordeal.  My mother is also in a total  pain and complete shell of shock and grief. She is unable to process all  to process what has happened and is going on with her life. She is completely lost. My step-or how can't she has become a burden in denial. She is unable to process of control of handling this event is much more than  it's effects flow with each passing day. This event. It will be an even.

Dear mohamedg@fastermail.com,

Thank you very much for the timely attention regarding your recent correspondence with our sister institution, The University of Texas at Austin.  We in the Austin office are familiar with the legal requirements surrounding some of the transactions discussed above.  Rest assured that we will comply with the legal requirements in this transaction, however,  it is important to point out that we cannot ""force"" you to do certain things.  For instance,  you said that you will cooperate with our attorneys in this transaction, but our attorneys have requested that we not demand that you do certain things (for example,  not to speak with our CFO about our salary demands).  If my attorneys can do this, why can't we?  If not, then there is a problem.  Please explain to me why we cannot do certain things so that I can work with our attorneys to make sure that this transaction does not fall into that category.  Once again, your urgent response to this urgent request is greatly appreciated.

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Imperial Bank of China in favour of the Sierra Leone Mine Development Corporation of (S.M.D.C) the original value of these contracts were carefully evaluated and approved for transfer by the Chinese firm in their favour to our Bank in Mainland China before the finalizing of the projects. Upon the finalization of the projects the Chinese firm directed that my colleague and I should transfer the total amount to their account, I accordingly obliged and sent a routine notification to the Chinese Banking Corporation (CB). The money was then sent to my nominated account, I have one of the top priority consignment as coming from the Chinese Government corporate or Government agency which was approved for delivery in the first batch.

Dear BEN AMOBI

Thank you very much for the quick turnaround. I was not aware of the late charge.   The other charge I have received is unacceptable.   Please provide me with details on any witnesses having administrative or legal difficulties.   I will shortly be transferring an Administrator to another position.   My priority now will be the legal review required of all non governmental organizations.   Please have someone back in your area who can review these documents for correctness. This process will take up to 24 months.   Once all the documents are reviewed by the legal department I will give you a call to resend to the legal department.   Once you have received the status of these proceedings please call me back.

Thanks again for your quick reaction.

Ben

Title: Urgent Assistance Please
 Urgent Assistance Please ATTN  PLS; Dear one,   Struggling with the courage to speak to you in confidence,   trusting that you will not let me down in your future. I know that this will come to you as a surprise,   but be sure that you will not let me down in future as I will ring you on my   behalf to let you know that i have $21,500,000.00 US dollars which i found in   a slave trader   from Ghana called Mr. Hilaire Taylor, who died in a air crash along with his entire family. I   decided to contact you based on trust, because after all these years, you are still not informed of what   the government is doing to me and my family. I got your contact from the World Bank, during my search for a reliable and honest person  to handle the transfer of this amount to you, without any backtrace. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a   family member.   I have been in this Country for about 13 years. There is this large sum of money which my late father deposited with a Security and Finance Company, (S.F.F.) as family valuables.  I want you to assist me and my family by receiving this money as a potential business partner and invest this fund in your country or anywhere as you see fit.   You will be entitled to 20% of this money for your assistance while 10% will be set aside to offset all expenses in   connection with the fund and my family.   Please note that this transaction is risk free.There is no way around the issue.   I have the security cover of a member of my family, and also a security cover of a  company which sells electrical appliances.   If you accept to assist my family, I will require you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.  If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message  so we can go over the details.  Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.  I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate when I have received your mail.   If you are not interested, do not hesitate to contact me immediately through my confidential  e-mail address: nenita100@tiscali.co.uk.   Please, do not bother me if by some miracle you find your way back to me, as I will not want  you to redistribute this money amongst yourselves.  If upon your return please do not hesitate to contact me through my private   email: nenita100@tiscali.co.uk, please do not  affect the confidentiality of this transaction.   Yours faithfully, Mrs NNITA ATINE.

Dear nenita100@tiscali.co.uk,

I will be out of the office on Tuesday, August 21, and all staff will be  required to submit their resignation on or about this day.  I cannot sign you up for a salary raise or  relocation if you are not willing to give that up for financial reasons.  You won't believe it, but  I am giving you an ultimatum...  Yes, you are  required to give me a salary raise or i will fire all of my employees.  I was planning on asking  you to approve the move  to Houston, but you told me that you couldn't  sign me up for a salary raise without first going to Houston.  So, I am trying to  negotiate a salary with you before I go.  That's why I am asking you to give me a break on the -------------------------------------> salary.  I don't want to give you a salary increase that you  couldn't live on if you wanted to.  I want you to take a hard look at the cost  involved and give me a hard time for not giving you a hard  look at the cost.  After some back and forth, I am saying that I will go with the raise when I get back to Houston on my  sabbatical.  That's it.  No negotiations, no salary, just  facts.  

Thanks, NONE

I hope you can forgive my delay in contacting you.    Perhaps you will see fit to invite me back into your life?
  
 I have some very good friends in your area that would love to have dinner with us this Friday.   I just got back from visiting my family in Barcelona.   I was absolutely speechless.   My oldest son got married last Saturday and my new bride was named after him.  My first love, Jose, was killed in a car crash.   My second love, Cara, was involved in a motorcycle accident that almost killed her.    I love life and am  very fortunate to be in a position  with an income that allows me to live a life of luxury and comfort.   I am very excited about the upcoming  holidays and how they will impact my family.   I am also very fortunate to be in possession of two amazing dogs that I raise for  special needs.   They are named after my parents and my step-mother.   My step-mother is an only child and behavioral therapist.  This dog is named after my grandmother and my step-grandmother was a bitch but she got shit done and we  are all still pretty cut up.  This dog is named after my great-grandmother and my great-grandfather was raised in this terrible home  .  He was a part of a family that moved  from Georgia to California and had everything  you could ever want.   He was an only child and raised in this horrible home and still suffers from flashbacks.   I  love life and am  very blessed to be in this position.   I have a job  that supports my family and I live in a nice neighborhood that is  completely different than the one I grew up in.  I went to UC Berkeley,  a great school with great professors and an awesome alumni  group.  My mom is a schoolteacher and I still spend a lot of time with her afternoons on the  beach.  My dad is an account manager for an internet company that  we both  worked for.   We sold it and moved on with our lives.   For 3 years

I've been out of the office and home for the past 7 days.  It is so unfair that I've had to let go.  I'm so sorry if anyone is upset with me because I was not the biggest fan of the new year.   My sister wasnt going to let me go down that road.   I am sooooo going to cry myself to sleep if I hear any bad things about me.   I will be back on Jan 2nd.   I was going to let you know today, but I got stuck in traffic.   I will try and call yesterday, but I don't see any sign of you.    I hope I'm not breaking up your life, but it seems like a lot of things keep happening to make your life a living hell.   My life sucks, but its okay.   Kids don't even know how bad things really are.   I am doing pretty well, but it takes a while for things to hit me in the ass.   I will get back up tomorrow, but  I need  to take care of my head since this is in fact the worst time of year to be depressed because of the new year.   I am living in fear that I will lose my house, my car, I have been to several doctors, one of which thought that I did not have a pulse, and he thought I was drunk.  I was on the phone with my family to report my findings, and he asked me what was wrong, since I had just been to the hospital, and his was the chief of all the meds.  Because of the way I was feeling, I did not want to hear the story of how  I had caused all this, instead I was going to sleep.   Sleep, I told myself, and  kept to myself.   After about an hour, I woke up to the sound of crickets outside.  Who was it?   The sound of a broken window woke me up?   Or was it just a heavy rain?  I looked out my bedroom window and saw my  car window just start rolling down the hill with my taillight still on it.  I jumped out of bed and looked out my bathroom window into the yard.  It was overinflated, it was obvious that someone had moved  into our home, and my front yard looked like it would be a dump.

Dear miss mary,

I received the card today (impressed that  you are not a botanist), and there is a problem with the signature. Please can you look at the other ones I have sent already. The signature on this one is not too bad, but I must change the first 10 digits. Please can you change that?  It is much too late to bother anyone else,  especially since I sent this to one of  your contact, and there is nothing  that you can do about it.

I can't believe you did not get back with me first, so I am going to go out on a limb and assume you did, and send  you another one.  Sorry I did not get back with  you, I am out of the office now.

It is ok though, I just wanted to check on a possible settlement, if you had any  doubts about  sending me another one.  After all, I have your address and we just signed a new one, right?

Let me know if you want to send me another one, and I will get back with  you ASAP about the settlement.  I just wanted to  see how much time remains in the day, so we can work out the settlement, if any  doubt arises, just ask.  This is just an  example, I am going to send another check next week, with my new address, to remind you of the time  difference.  You have no idea how many emails I get, and how much time  it takes to send each one.  So, I just wanted to  see how your reaction was to the new address, and to see how we are doing, when you send your  first one.  If you send me your feedback at all, I will keep this example in mind, so you can see how we are doing, and how difficult it is to get  everything done.  You have always wanted to be my servant, and I could not agree more.  We finally broke up, and I moved in with my girlfriend, Stephanie, because I could not get myself to leave you.  I had to get myself out, and she had to get myself out, because we broke up 5 months ago.  Now, we are fine, but I just wanted to  go home, and try to put the past  behind us.

I'm so glad you sent the email because I would have never gotten to know your son if it was not for me.  You have been wonderful.

Mary is in her second year as the Business Resource Manager for Veracruz.  She is succeeding Mrs. C. Woodson as President.  My role at Veracruz is entirely different and she and Veracruz are using her to get involved with various groups in the community.  I was worried that she would be overworked and didn't have enough free time on her  calendar.  I know she will have a much easier time with the baseball team because the  other responsibilities, such as taking care of the family, will fall on her plate.  I wasn't planning on leaving until the fall.  That said, I am  leaving today and will be leaving tomorrow to get a fresh start.  I will be  coming home with lunch and a visit from Veracruz.  I will be able to visit your son today and will present him with the award.   Your son has taught me so much about forgiveness and what it takes to make it work.  It is a huge honor and a privilege to be  sharing this experience with you.  I will miss having you by my side.   You have always showed concern for me and my family, even when it was  difficult.  Your tenderhearted attitude and way of dealing with criticism has always made me feel at home.  When people criticize me for  not having children, I always respond with a question  - Does she have any children?  Usually the response is a resounding ""no"".  Then people ask me my opinion of your conduct, and I often feel the need to remind them that I am not their father but my son.  My responses are always the same.   I worry that my schedule is overwhelming them and that I do not have time to spend with them.  At work, I read, write, and do what I was told toil for years toil toil toil just get something done.  That is enough for those that I could do."	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0054.png			Machine

Dear Dr. MOHAMMED  ZUBA:

Thank you so much for the kind words. I, too, was touched by the hospitable attitude of your hospitable, empathetic, and understanding wife. In fact, I wrote to her yesterday to say how much I enjoyed our ""free"" time together as family. She replied that it was not a lot of time, but she was very interested in getting to know you better and was very appreciative. She encouraged me to keep in touch and to stay connected to my family in SF. I plan on doing just that.

I have always been interested in your intellectual side, so I was delighted when you suggested we take a ""family"" vacation.  I was on a blind date with a guy I met on the job search committee. His name is not familiar to me, but his CV is very interesting.  I was impressed with how much time out of the country he has already put into the job search, and his passion is clearly in making it a difference in people's lives.  We will be spending a few weeks in Texas helping older kids with English asyleensities, and he has a lot of experience in that area. My wife is a kids program for them, and I thought I had a low threshold need of an income as well.  I was hoping he could help on the kids from him in the tech side.  I have them in tech in house, but he is a tech for tech, and tech







 I am so we enjoyed spending time together was discussing how we decided we hit upon returning next move to have kids and plan for January (saturday we will be here in May, but we need of clothes and we need of a new place, and the kids to take stock to the kids.

Today was a blur of many painful events that have been going on in my life.   My first period was very hard.  I tried to keep up with my period each day for the last 7 days.  

As painful as it can be, I believe I have to do this because I have been a distraction to my family and I am absolutely devastated by the loss of my son.  My step-mom was my best friend on  Match.com.  I was completely hooked up with her for the first 3 days.  We hit it off right away and it was clear she would be a great mother to our son.

For your assistance I have propose to give you 25% of the total sum, I have further advised that the remaining 70% be for you,your contribution is non-refundable.

Dear Mrs Amina Tijani:

I shall be pleased to make other arrangements for your family. The Managing Director of ACE Asia Pacific, which is   a branch office of HSBC in Thailand, is interested in investing in   the oil and gas sectors.   My family and I are however, not able to participate  in this venture at this stage because we are  not sponsored by ChevronTexaco or Shell,   entities that you are aware of.   However, we are looking for partners that are committed to   creating jobs and  restoring prosperity to our countries.   You are aware that I have been involved in various forms of non-governmental activity  related to the economies of t he two countries for a number of years now.   I believe that this is something that I am good at.   I hope that you are not wondering why I am not sending my son to school  or why he is not attending church.   If you are interested in contributing to this venture,  please contact me.   The project has not started  yet but I do have some compelling reasons.   As you probably know, my wife is an attorney and we have accepted an  additional child into the family last year.   We finally sold our old  house and moved into a new one; this new home is much larger, better equipped with everything you need to  live in it for the next 6 months.   We finally bought a big enough house that we can call our own.   All of this has prepared me for the challenges ahead.   I have not had the pleasure of being your spouse, however, I have had the privilege of being married to the love of my life, Jose Luis  Son.  We finally got married on September 22, 2000, in the beautiful Rose Garden of the White House.   We celebrated our union in the Rose Garden with my mother and sister, and my step-father and step-mother-in-law.   I was 18 at the time.  Since then, I have been married to the love of my life, Jose Luis  Son, and we have a son and daughter-in-law to raise.   We finally sold our old house and moved into a new one; this new home is much larger, better equipped with everything you need to live in it for the next 6 months.   We finally bought a big enough house that we can call our own.   Our old house was riddled with holes

The deceased account had been running for about 2 years before it was discovered that the money was missing. The actual amount in the account is(U.S.$2,220,000.00)two million, ten thousand two hundred and twenty united state dollars (us$2,220,000.00).However, the management decided to look for a trust worthy foreign partner abroad, who will assist us in repatriating the fund to his country, or any other country of his choosing, as soon as possible because the management no longer knows the client's foreign account holder or beneficiary.The foreign account holder is a deceased account holder in a number of different countries including the UK, USA, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Holland, Denmark, Portugal, Switzerland and China. The account was opened in these countries without any other person knowing about it.The account has expired and all attempts to track the account owner have come to naught.I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of the Audit Committee of the F.N.A.W (A.C.A) to look for a foreign account to receive the fund on behalf of the management, as all documentations will be in the management's control and we will share the money accordingly.  Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information's; 1. Your private and confidential telephone and fax number; 2. Your banking information, including name and address, account details and other relevant information, to enable us file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favour before the transfer could be made.  3. Your specific bank name and address, preferably with direct telephone and fax number. I await to hearing from you soon.  Yours faithfully MR CHARLES MORGAN

Dear  Sandra:

Thank you so much for your quick response.  It is very ironic that it was just a few short days ago that I called you the most selfish person in the class.   I was very upset that after the incident you  callously  threatened my safety.  Do you really think that I would go out of my way to avoid turning in my resignation because you  threatened my safety?  That is a big  deal.  How can you be so irresponsible as to threaten my safety  and then walk out of my office knowing that I have your resignation in my office?  That is a huge  deal.  You have threatened my safety numerous times since I first met you.  I was very upset that you  threatened my safety again today.   I have always respected your right to be upset, but I was not intending to cause a scene or incite a riot.   I hope you can get some healing from this experience.  You have been out of the office for over an hour.   I have been out of the office for almost two and a half hours.   I am sure there are other incidents that you feel strongly about but I feel that you have let down your family and  my job is now.   You can call me but I will not be there to stop you.   You have been out of the office for over an hour.   I have been out of the office for almost two and a half hours.   I have been out of the office for almost two and a half hours.   I have felt a great sense of relief and accomplishment because I have been apart of a great family  reunion.  I have a hard  time believing that we pulled this off.   I have cried myself to sleep at night.   I have been up all night worrying about how you are doing.   I have convinced myself that this whole situation is just a big game of chicken with me.   I would have totally lost it if I was involved.   I was trying to scare you into accepting the fact that I was gay.   If you ever finds yourself in that situation, I would love to be a part of it.   You have always been there for me, whether it be in the form of a supportive family, a supportive  community, or a support group for people like  you.   I can't believe we pulled this off.

Currently, there are no guidelines  for obtaining a business  license, and quite a few hurdles to clear.  Please provide me with some guidance to get me started on this path.  I have been in contact with several business  licensees in California who seem to be issuing  licenses in large numbers, and who I would definitely want to  discuss with you ASAP in order to get a head start on the necessary paperwork.  Depending on your response, I will send you information about how to get my finger  on the pulse of California licensing.  We just had a pretty big  surprise when it came time to renew our business  license.  My response  is still pending, but my hope is that you will allow me to continue in this  area pending our appeal.  In the meantime, I have started to receive a flood of tips from around the globe regarding our  situation.  It is amazing how quickly information can travel   freely during a 24-hour period.  Thanks to all of you for your assistance.   I can't believe our business did not work out   with such a dramatic impact on our family.  I was away from home on business for the weekend, and my son and daughter  were both sick and had to be removed from the hospital.  My family is  still very much bonded together, and I have received so many beautiful cards from around the world.  I  love every single one of them, and I send them all back home with the greatest  gratitude.  My only regret is that our marriage failed to take off, and that my absence has limited our  family's independence.  Our relationship is stronger than ever, and I am excited about the future.   My son is in college, and my daughter is on her first year of  graduate school.  We want to start a family, and I am  planning on starting a family with him.  My oldest son is in the hospital  with a hip replacement, and he is out until June 2.  I am   very excited about having a family of his

My thoughts:

1.  It is early March, and I still don't understand the payroll deduction.  Will this be appealed?

2.  It is late August, and I have not heard from you  about the status.  I assumed that you had moved on, but this  is new, so I have not  received any responses regarding the expired lease, etc.

Dear CEO,
 
 I, too, was in company with  Arkin and Farmer  in Houston last week.  I was  not brought into the picture until last week  when GM hired you.  Farmer and  Arkin were not brought on the  same day.  I was actually brought in yesterday by Landau .   I'll get together with him  today to discuss his new hire.   Personally, I prefer  not to have to  coordinate with Landau  over GM's new acquisition.  That said, I have asked GM to take  our conversation out of the ordinary.  Any ideas on how to do that?

Sure, we could always talk on the phone on Saturday.  That's a lot of  free time to do some shopping.  Plus, you never know what kind of questions would be asked  if we didn't already have a pretty good  conversation on the phone.   The questions would be the same  regardless of where we are.   It's quite  interesting, actually, to think about.  How did you get started in this business?  Where have you been?  Where are you working?  Do you have a  good portfolio of investments?  How much has your family made?  How  do you manage a portfolio of your investments under  pressure?   It's a really fascinating life  of  investments.   When you started out, you had a pretty good job  making $40,000/yr. Now you make $250,000/yr.  Your company, again, has done quite well.   But, you are still  dealing with highly stressful and uncertain  global business situations.   You have a son  with a new offer from GE that he wants to take advantage of.    I understand he is technically  a ""contract"" employee, but I wanted to  take a look at his severance package to see if  it might be too steep of a price to pay for the privilege.  I also wanted to see if  we could negotiate a discount  for them so that they wouldn't have to swallow $250,000 in severance  compensation when they sell the assets to GE and  can choose to keep the remaining cash for themselves.    I guess I'm starting to see why people  were calling you the previous day.  I was starting to feel the anxiety of the unknown.

Title: URGENT
 URGENT Attn/Pls Dear Sir/Madam, I am Barrister Bahram el Sisi, a Solicitor. I was a Contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria before my retirement in early 2001. One of my colleagues and I were involved in the contract award and recommendation review with a foreign contracting firm in the Federal Ministry of Rail Transport and Communications (FMRC) here in Nigeria for the supply of ammunations, hard/soft wares,phamaceuticals/medical items,light and heavy duty vehicles, ammunations procured from United Nations  ATOMI and other international agencies. We were involved in supplying equipment for the purchase of aircraft,phantom aircraft,consignment and equipment for the supply chain development of the Federal Ministry of Rail Transport and Communications (FMRC) here in Nigeria. We are the only partners with whom we have a position in this business. We negotiated a down payment of 35% of the total sum to be used in collaboration with you for the purchase and lease of an aircraft,to be used for civilian and military purposes respectively, by the Federal Ministry of Rail Transport and Communications (FMRC) here in the country. The equipment was supposed to be delivered to you as a result of a positive balance in our favour to enable us take delivery of the equipment in your name. Instead, we received negative balances as a result of over invoicing and over invoiced taxes,and as such, we are seeking to transfer the equipment into your account to enable us transfer the funds to your country for investment purposes. We agreed on the amount when we met in my chambers the previous month. We have agreed to share the equipment and relevant funds as follows:- (1) 70% for us (2) 10% for you (3) 5% for the expences both will incure during the time of transfer. We hope to invest our share in a real estate project in your country as you will be our business partner. Please note that this transaction is risk free. If the equipment is delivered to you as desired and your company's role is properly filled, we shall organize and implement the project in your country into the schedule and estimate as soon as the equipment is in your possession. At the conclusion of the transfer, you will be given 35% of the total sum, 60% will be for me and you while 5% will be for the expences both will incure during the time of the transfer. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you, I await your urgent mail. You can reach me with my confidential fax number +23416704189 or you can send me email to allow me brief you the procedure. Awaiting to hear from you soon Mr Bahram el Sisi.

During the war, some private security company officers were on leave, when the conflict erupted in my country. I was made to work as a personal security guard to the President of the Republic of Sierra Leone after the death of the former President, ROBERT VANESSA, during a military campaign, which took us a long time to resolve. During this time I was regularly in Sierra Leone, mainly to pick up shipments from the Customs, who had to change their shipping containers to take goods through the Suez Canal tow as a protection for his precious Diamonds. The Sixty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars was changed into your account when the former President was killed. I am presently in England, working with a private firm, as a civil servant, so I cannot operate a foreign account, but I have made arrangement to have that right. Within the last few days, my proposal to you was accepted by a member of the staff of the private security company who is a Diamond/Gold Merchant and he directed me into business relationship with you. We have decided to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, and 2% for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction, which includes, telephone bills, theft and any form of general miscellaneous would be borne by you. We have decided to business relationship because you are familiar with private sector and you would be expected to assist us in investment in your country. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Mr.Steve Besnih

Dear Mr. Steve Besnih.

I have been out of the office and have just seen your email.  I was wondering if you could call me ASAP and discuss the most  expeditious way to close a US$350M ($585MM loan) unfunded foreign direct investment (FDI) project in your country.  It is a long-term project and requires a lot of finance, but there was no apparent way this could be funded without adversely impacting US manufacturing. You did mention that the project should be in place by May 2010, which seems to be a reasonable horizon for a project of this duration.  I  presume that you received this message in your system as well, but could you look at it and let me know if there are any  problems with it before I forward my response. Thanks.

I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF THIRTY-ONE MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS(US$30,500,000)WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE ACTUAL CONTENTS. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO NOW IS TO INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME AND MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF. THE ACCOUNT REQUIRED FOR THIS PROJECT CAN EITHER BE PERSONAL,COMPANY OR AN OFFSHORE ACCOUNT THAT YOU HAVE TOTAL CONTROL OVER,YOUR AREA OF SPECIALISATION WILL NOT BE A HINDERANCE TO THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF THIS TRANSACTION. ACKOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE,SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY FAMILY AS OUR FOREIGN TRUSTED PARTNER WHO SHALL TAKE CHARGE OF OUR INVESTMENT ABROAD WHERE WE NOW PLAN TO SETTLE.

Title: Re: Re: Good Day,

Please be advised that I will be out of the office on Monday, and  will resend the letter ASAP. However, I have other things to do and, obviously, are  not allowed to  attend the hearing.  For example, my wife is out of the country for the holidays.  The  child support attorney is holding the child support  arbitration hearings on December 12th.  I have been out of the office since the  first  day I received the notice.  I will be out of the office until  Christmas.  That is, unless you get together and talk  about some wacky  reason you want to see your son.  Then you must wait until January 2nd,  for the hearing to take place.  I have been out of the  office since last Friday, and have been away from the office  for a couple of weeks.  Once the child support  attorney talks with your son, it is his turn to give evidence.  The father is being very difficult to keep up with.  It is a constant battle being raised funds  and keeping his costs down.  We finally broke even when we sold our old  house and moved into a new one, that is about a mile south of my mom.  We are very fortunate that our old lady is still around.  She is our pillar of family and is always there to help us.  She is very spiritual and always looking for a reason to laugh or cry.  We have been to several weddings and  children's hospital visits over the past few  years, and have never looked back.  We are very blessed.  However, we are also very blessed to have a strong  family and to have found a place of our own.   We still call Phoenix our  home, and we are very happy here.  A place that accepts and cares for us.  However, we are not homeless any longer.  We are  still extremely thankful for all the good times we had, and we will  always treasure the time we had together.   Please don't forsake your family and yourself for a moment.  This young man has done much  to make our home and our family so special.  His  faith, like his family, is based on his faith that angels are real and that He will keep His commandments.     Please take this in and accept it like water.""

Title: URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION
 URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION Dear, I am BARRISTER ZACHI GUYO, the lawyer and Legal Officer of the Zambian Government Contract award Fund. I have an urgent and
 from the office of the Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources,I awarded a total of US$29,500,000.00 (Thirty Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to a foreign Contractor to the tune of US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty One Million Thirteen United States Dollars) for the construction of copper, Gold or Diamond mines in the Republic of Zambia. The contract was actually awarded in favour of the Chinese firm (Electricité Commercial Power) but was changed to the non-Chinese candidates after the re-election of President Robert Mugabe. As a result of the change of government in my country and with our part in the re-election of President Robert Mugabe, we were given the option of paying the contract into the hands of the Chinese firm or to have the contract closed down.I chose the latter option as the contract is fully controlled and both parties have satisfied all legal requirements. The contract was due to be paid to the Chinese firm in 2001 but was paid to a different Chinese firm in 2002. In order to avoid the Chinese firm from claiming the money, I want you to provide a good position for the payment of the contract to the Chinese firm in your country. On indicating your willingness,I will furnish you with the details and procedure. I have sufficient legal documents that can be used for the payment of the contract. All I require is your honest co-operation for us to see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Note: If you are  willing to assist me,please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more information and the relevant parts of the Payment Agreement between us. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this deal is 100% risk free. Awaiting your urgent reply.  zachi_2010@fastermail.com Yours faithfully, BARRISTER ZachI

Dear zachi,
 
   I have finished the Thomas G. and Lynn P. report and would like to forward to the Legal and Regulatory Oversight Committee.   Please let me know if there are any other changes and we can get this done in time for  the Regulatory Oversight Committee meeting in Building 6.   The legal opinion that we need to provide the Legal Team is that the Contract can be made out to us in January and we need to provide it to them in March.   It would be prudent to request an exemption for this transaction as the transaction could be done in our name and the legal opinion of ACO is that we need to wait until the Reg is through with the other transactions.   Please advise.

 On November 21 the Committee will hold a hearing on      the status of the TFA program.   The status of the program in your opinion is     fair and the TFA program has been effective in lowering turnover and increasing service to the      lowest common denominator.   This process should be in place early in 2001 to provide adequate opportunity    for all parties to participate and compete in     this important area.   Regards,

I was not present because my   son was in the shower.   Your daughter is not involved in the complaint hearing.  Your son is a junior in college and you wanted to   see what he looked like.   I will look forward to meeting with him and presenting findings    to the committee.   The hearing will be at 2:30 on Friday, November 24.   Your participation is    requested.   I have already arranged transportation for you and your family to and from the    meeting.   I will inform you  of the date

Title: Re: Re: URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION
Yes, I was on November 14. My frequency will be increased to 
 ensure that I am in position to answer ASAP ASAP on this issue.   I think we should discuss the  appropriate form of ERCOT to use (i.e., system agnostic,  multi-modal, based, reporting to OMLX, etc.).   By the way, if you were wondering why  my  phone hasn't been ringing off of this issue for days, it has because of   you.   This is probably a good  reason to discuss this further.   I will be in charge of getting this sorted out.  

I have spoken with a number of parties interested in meeting with  you to sort this out.   Most notably, are the individuals involved in the complaint case against Duke Energy.  We received assurances from them that they would present reasonable explanations for the  irregularity in the system use.  In addition to Duke Energy,  Comcast, Morgan Stanley, Lehman  Merrill, and others have contacted us in various capacities since  your last phone call. We are trying to find common ground so that you can try to work together to  resolve this issue.   I believe that Steve Khatib (Comcast's CTO) will be contacting all of the  individuals involved in this complaint, as he is an advisor to the company and wants to   participate in the process.   I would suggest that you call him ASAP to see if he is available to help in any way. I think the next phone call will be extremely interesting because he has not sent  any financial documents to us.   Thanks

Title: Urgent Proposal !
 Urgent Proposal ! Mr .Volle  Furniss  Billet  London, UK.E.O.C ATTN: President/CEO Dear Sir/Madam, I am Mr.Volle , a Director of Cayman Islands  Reserve Bank (C.I.B) and an Authorized Account Control Officer with a Bank in Cayman Islands,  (A.C.C.) . I have an urgent and profitable business proposition  for you that should be handled with extreme confidentiality. We want  to transfer to a foreign account the sum of US$22,500,000.00 (Twenty Million Two Hundred  Dollars).  This money was  generated from over-invoicing of contracts executed  by my Bank and my proposal is that I would like you to be the beneficiary and  the next of kin of the fund. I am aware of the consequences of this proposal  but I feel it is my duty as an Account Officer to her country or  any other part of the world where my money will be safe to do business  with the person or company that will benefit from the transaction.  My proposal is that you will be given 20% of the total sum  for your services, 70% will be for me, while 5% will be for  the expenses incurred in the course of the transaction. I have all necessary  legal documents that will back you up when telling the fund to turn over the  money to the person you want it to be given to.  All I need is some trust and confidence from you. If you can be of  trust and assistance to me, I will greatly appreciate it, please reply to my private  email address on the above. But please do not reply to my official  mail: (vollebank@she.com)  I want to assure you that this business is 100% risk free as we have  conducted all the arrangements with the relevant Government Agencies,  as we have proved in our last audit report to be accurate and  legal, with full legal documentation to back up our claim,  you can be assured that this transaction will be properly handled with absolute  confidence.   If this proposal is acceptable by you, please do not hesitate to contact me immediately by  expediting the above indicating your interest for us to discuss the modalities of  seeing this transaction through. I wish to state here again that confidentiality should be maintained at all  stages, as this is required for the success of this transaction.   Be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because  of the volume of money involved.   Keep in mind that we are professional and  organized people and this business must be carefully managed for  optimal profit potential.   Best regards,   MR.VINCENT KONA

Title: Urgent  Business Proposal
 Urgent  Business Proposal Dear Friend, I am Zuhair Idris, the son of Late Mr. Laurent Gube of Sierra Leone, who was assassinated by the rebels during the war in my country. I inherited a total sum of $18,000,000.00 (Twenty Eight Million United States dollars) from my late father. This money was deposited by my late father in a high secured security company in Dakar, Senegal, to avoid any shock to the family fortune if he were to die. This large sum of money was deposited in a security-reserve vault, awaiting claim by my government if/when need be.  Now this money belongs to me as a foreign beneficiary, I am 18 years old and a legal resident in the Senegal, my main purpose of contacting you is for you to help me receive this consignment into your account in any part of your country. This money was deposited as family valuable after my late father's death. It is stuck in a holding security-reserve bank here in Dakar, with my name as the next of kin.  This deposit was made to avoid the bank from confiscating or freezing the account in my name. No record is known about this account by the bank as no one knows about this account, the card in my name alone has deposited and the security-reserve bank does not know the owner.  If you accept to assist my family in this transaction, I hope you will treat it with utmost confidentiality and courtesy, keeping strictly confidential.  I am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication.I alone have the means of contacting you and I alone know of the contents of the mail.I will need you to come to my country immediately so as to claim this money in your country or anyone in your country's name, as all arrangements will be made for you there immediately you receive the money.  I will also need you to assist me in investing this money in a lucrative business. Your time is of the essence here, I assure you 100% security and risk free involvement.  If this proposal satisfies you, please indicate your telephone or fax number for more details, and you will be highly rewarded, I assure you of that.  Awaiting your urgent reply via my alternative email:   email: zuhair2001@yahoo.com I await to hear from you. Yours sincerely, Zuhair Idris.

This fund was a client deposit and the beneficiary address was a person who was a foreigner, and an investment in a multi-billion dollar company in South Africa. Though the company did not exist then but there is an investment in a multi-million dollar business being conducted in this company's product and technology which is suitable for investment by foreign firm. The said investment is under my supervision and technology.  In the course of our business we were able to transfer the fund to a safe foreign account operated by the firm and the investment is now being carried out in the United States. The management is happy to admit to you that the fund was transferred in this transaction with the help of my secretary and that we have settled all the contractual claims against the firm.  I have the opportunity to invest this money on a big business in your country which you will manage, guide and assist us in doing the business over there than returning the money to South Africa where I want you to invest it.

I was concerned that my extended family might not want us to go, but they have decided not to stop in Utah.  I was worried that we would have to drive all the way there just to see our daughter.

Our duties include recommendation to foreign countries on where to invest foreign exchange and so on.We have already made some recommendations to other government parastatals for help in the past and foundering our own funds is not an option than to help of the present situation.

Dear Lao C. 

My thoughts are as follows: 

Please arrange for my transportation to the best available service

If you insist on traveling with me, there is a very good chance that the trip will be ""economy limited"" in nature and, thus, the ""economy hitchhiking"" portion of the deal.   This portion of the deal is fine-tuned to avoid these sorts of issues.  In fact, I read with interest  the comments section of this e-mail and the first  person to respond was Matt Motley, President of Kenton-based Global Markets and Trading.  He was kind enough to send  me a link to his website and a short time later I got  this e-mail from him.  It  looks like he's upgraded his services to be more in line  with the ""no fakes"" policy that his business is based upon.   He is an Enron Certified Public Account  maker, so you are welcome to use his services  however you wish.  If you wish to  request a ""no fakes"" policy in exchange for a service that I can provide, then you would do well  to request that I provide it now in exchange for a service  that you may not be able to provide in the future.  Allow me to  focus on the positive here, and to you in the future  transactions that will help us make ends meet.  I need to have  something ready in the next couple of days to send to all our members, and then to  ship out the merchandise to our distribution center. I'll have more to say about the ""no fakes"" policy  today or in the morning. Thanks again for your help.

The City Attorney in San Antonio, Wendy O'Neal, has asked Jerry Boynton to expedite the case of the  Firestone family against the City of San Antonio.   Because of the urgency of the case, I have asked him to postpone the  award of the Firestone family patent to the City of San Antonio until we get our  patent attorney.   I would need three attorneys to file the necessary paperwork to make this  award effective January 1, 2002.   The City Attorney has indicated she will not accept the  award until we get our patent attorney.   So, Mr. Boynton's son Zach is now the legal representative for the  Firestone family.   We are trying to get a copy of the Permits that were issued to the  City of San Antonio.   Please request an expedited case review, since we need  this document ASAP in case we need to file our own to comply with  the City of San Antonio.   Thanks.   Michelle

I wanted to use this opportunity to request for assistance in the business of investment and consequent transfer of the funds to a foreign account, because I need your firm's assistance in  operations in your country. Because my present location is not safe such as if I left the fund in your country.

I will be very glad if you will consider my proposal and take this proposal very serious.

Maybe you can share some of your success stories with him.  He needs to hear from you about how he can remain motivated.  He needs to know you believe in him.

Your comments were very helpful and I am pleased to hear that your son is doing well.  It was a pleasure to talk with you today and look forward to meeting with you and your family in the near future.  As to the transaction, I have spoken with my wife and we will not be able to travel immediately so we will have to take a bus.  Bus ride would be ~$20-$30 and transfer is not as expensive as you may think.  What's left after transportation to Orlando or Miami?

I need to get back to Seattle ASAP so we can get our son an attorney and finally make our decision.  It is very unclear right now what the law requires before we can sell the property.  I know you are concerned about his future so I want to be sure we are doing everything we can to make sure he is not in danger.  Please do not hesitate to call or email me if you want to talk about the transaction or have questions.

Yes, sir. I will be out of the office  on Monday, April 15.  I have texted Dan to inform him that we have  cut costs.  He has instructed his team to get together and provide cost  projections to the DA.  He has asked me to get together with my business group to  discuss how we can best help in this area.  I would be happy to provide that information in a  similar vein to the other information that was provided to me by your department.  Your team has been fantastic so far.  I have not had a chance to visit with  your assistant just yet, but I assume that she is busy with other  people.  Anytime after 8 AM would be perfect.  I would love to see you before that time.

Chris. From my limited conversations with you, it sounds like you are wanting to  get together ASAP to discuss some cost containment with energy  vendors.  My response is  yes, sir.  The 15% cap may seem like a lot, but remember, this is just a guideline and we are  considering adding more events up there rotation.  The real issue is how do you determine which events are  valuable and which are not.  The mistake I see coming from your is giving vendors a free  pass to exceed this.  Again, I do not condone behavior that would allow for an environment where  anyone could abuse this.  My hope is that you will use your authority  to stop this and that we can agree on specific actions that  you will take to ensure that vendors cannot do  this again.  Once again, I would love to be able to help in this  area but I have to come from a different  position on certain issues.  My goal is not to be your slave.  My goal is to be your ally and guide you in the  right direction.  Please let me know ASAP if you think that this is not a good idea.  I need to get back to you asap with my plan to prevent this from becoming an  institutional memory patch.

Dear         You are  in my thoughts, so I would like to respond in  a manner that is both  expeditious and in the best  position to avoid any  surprises down the road.  Let me  know ASAP if I need to talk to anyone else about this, so that  I can get started.  I need to get my head  round on this, as others have asked me already.      If you are still interested, please give me a call ASAP so that I can  get started.   You can reach me at (303) 713-1010.   The number  you gave me as input (1) caused the problem, (2) is on my calendar, and (3) is a channel that takes  calls for the NOLA area.  (You can change  the time zone if you want, but it is highly unlikely that this will help in the  short run, unless of  course, you change your mind and go to  work. In which case, I'll deal with it  today, but I need  a head start so I can get started  and be done before Christmas. Give me a call if you need  anything else.   Thanks.     Mandy

 Re: Possible Business Investment FROM: Richard Goodwin. Attn:SIR/CEO RE; ' PROF.R.G.  GOODWIN,  PROF.R.G. &amp; M.D
 RE;  PROF.R.G.  GOODWIN,  PROF.R.G. &amp; M.D  I am PROF.R.G.  GOODWIN, the Chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the Federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in favour of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in favour of a consortium of Multinationals in the Works and Housing Sector in favour of a company of which I was one of the few contractors that actually performed the project. The original value of these contracts were delibrately over invoiced to the sum of USD$25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars). This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names.  Where this fund will be transfered and how is not yet known to you. For further information please get in touch with me over the phone immediately, as soon as you receive this fax. Best Regards, PROF.R.G.  GOODWIN

Dear Prof. Richard Goodwin:

Yes.  I think we can go to court.  Myself and my partner are weighing legal issues.  Should we try to enfeeble a contract and beg forgiveness from the poor god?  Our pastor actually suggested we do just that.  The courts would probably think we were trying to steal something, as we had never bothered to get a court order before.  Judge William Rehnquist was very interested in what our business is.  He wanted to hear from our ""innovators"".  Our business is basically a series of ""marketing"" ideas that no one has tried yet.  Don't we have an ""innovator's dandy"" gene?  We need to show him that the technical know-how we picked up in college is actually transferable and that we can develop viable and valuable business ideas in the time it takes to make your day, or to make your day if we do steal something.  It's much better to have a brilliant, if somewhat embarrassing, series of presentations that show you how to make a living than have it blown out of proportion.

We may as well just try to start a ""Company B"" to market, since we already have a ""Company C"" under our belts.  I'd argue that a company C is actually in much worse shape than a ""traditional"" oil company.  Most of my ""innovations"" were actually conceived as a hedge against default, rather than as a start up.  If we want to make money, we need to raise capital, and if we raise capital, it's better if we do it now rather than wait till ""The Black Swan"" dies.  The insurance companies didn't exactly love ""The Black Swan"". 

I'm not saying we can't have nice things.  I'm saying we should have nice things to look forward to rather than looking forward to the worst case scenario.  That being said, I don't think ""the worst possible"" scenario is going to happen anytime soon, and there's a reason why we're in it.  

I'm not trying to start a ""company B"" today.  I'm trying to buy a business that can help ""the people"" in your area.  That's it.  You're not going to start a business that can help people in a time of need.  And the insurance that you and your ""innovators"" have built up doesn't even factor into this.  If

 I just got back from a trip to Barcelona, where we visited the old city hall and took some time to admire the old churches and get to know the people.  It was really cool and it was such an honor to do this trip with my parents.  I love Houston, Texas!  So, I did not get to see much of Houston, but my parents did manage to get me a pretty good tour of the old city.  I really enjoyed it.  Then we had a really good time in Poirier at the Tyne and I spent the night there with my parents.  Oh, and I took a weekend off from school to go to the Tyne and back.  It was a really fun weekend!  And really, the best part of the whole thing was when my parents took a cruise ship tour and had a baby shower for my older sister and me.  It was pretty surreal and really cool and I didn't even know how to describe it to my younger sister.  It was a blast.  And really, I didn't see any of it because I was so focused on the present that day.

What's up?  I'm calling on Gen for a refund on the ""same"" terms as the one they gave me.  Don't cut corners trying to get a refund, that's not ethical.    I'll be back in the morning to give you the verbal okay to proceed.    Also, Gen, do you think if I gave you a tough time about whether I was legally allowed to use Gen's money, would you please just explain to me why I shouldn't have?  The law is clearly on your side and you were right when you first got involved; it is your money, dammit!   My mom is concerned about my grades so far and I was wondering if it was her concern that got me into this mess in the first place.   Anyway, you can call Gen at (972) 893-2201 and you'll get a reasonable conversation starter.  But if you're worried about my grades, you need to call me  and let me know so I can make sure I'm not getting into any problems down the road.  Call me if you have any questions; I'm trying to keep abreast of everything.   Thanks.

Title: Very Urgent
 Very Urgent &amp; Confidential    Dear Friend, I am Mr. Aram V. Director, Contracts Award and review Committee of the Nigeria National Petroleum  Corporation (NNPC). I have a contract worth of US$35,000,000.00 (Thirty-five Million united state dollars). I am seeking your assistance in the transfer of this fund to a designated account on your  behalf and for investment in your country. I have the authority of the chair of the committee, who is a citizen of Liberia the first son of the late  President Charles Taylor, to recommend a foreign partner that I have persuaded the board of Directors of Liberia National Petroleum  Corporation to award me a contract of $35,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United States Dollars) to  protect our interests in the contract. My country is in dire need of an investment, the present Government is about to leave office with a rescript from the World Trade Organization,this rescript was due to excessive profit and  pressure from the United Nation of  aid agency (UNASIL). I have successfully negotiated a good percentage for your assistance, so I am willing to offer you 20% of the total sum.      I have also met with some members of the board of directors of Liberia National  Petroleum Corporation (LNPPC) who are in favour of my proposal and would enable me to transfer the funds out of Nigeria for investment in your country. All I require is your assistance to enable me complete the transfer and give the funds to you later. Please note that this transaction is risk free if properly handled. I am waiting for your urgent response. Yours faithfully, Mr. Aram V.

Thank you so much for your help.  My mother & father are very upset that something like this has happened.  They thought that you had moved into another house and that your father had moved out of the car.  They didn't want to hear about it.  I'm sure there have been other problems in your life but these were never problems.  My grandparents were very upset with me when I initially moved out of their > house.  They thought that something had to be done about it.  I guess I could try to explain to them how I came to the decision to leave their house.  Maybe we could even find a ""good"" time to see my grandparents in a few weeks.  Then you could go to sleep and have a good night.  It's just that simple.  And I'm just glad that you are trying to help find a solution.  Once I have determined a plan that is acceptable to everyone, I will reach out to your parents and explain to them why I have to get involved.  Perhaps we can talk on the phone in the morning and discuss what my involvement will entail.  Maybe we can walk to the store in the afternoon to >look for a box of tissues.  All we have to do is ask for a few >examples of good cheer to show that our situation is not as bad as everyone >makes it out to be.   I am very sorry my parents and grandparents.

Title: Re: Re:  URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE 

My thoughts are as follows:

1.  Autonomy -- Autonomy is my baby.  My other three are still alive and thriving.  Please don't cut me some slack.

2.  RESPONSIBLE -- For your son to be in this position now would be extremely irresponsible.  You wouldn't want to do anything rash.  You wouldn't want to put him in the lap of someone he doesn't  need to be in.  You wouldn't want to do anything that would give  him an inflated sense of importance.  You wouldn't want to put him in a position where he has to  constantly prove himself to everyone.  You wouldn't want to do  anything that would make him feel guilty or inadequate.

3.  ACTION -- I have instructed my staff to prepare to issue  ERCOT cards to all the parents for use in the Sonogram  Center.  You are assigned a nick-name so that  you don't have to answer when called upon.  Cards are issued  at random and parents are asked  to show identification to prove their identity.  No child is ever called into active duty in the Army or Navy, because  if he were deployed he would run afoul of the Uniform Code  for Missing Personnel.  Instead we use a sliding scale to determine which parent gets  the card, and that parent gets the child into the �?� school.  Each year we send about 40 students into the Sonogram  Center, and as of this year we have issued over 32,000  Sonogram cards to parents and children.  Most of these cards have  been used by their  guardians to gain access to the Sonogram Center, and we would love nothing more  than to celebrate the birth of our son at the  center.  However, we can't do that without you.  We need to show these  parents that our support is there when they need it most.  You have my word that  if they need it I will be there to help them.  Sometimes that means I have to come into your apartment and  visit them on my  own.  That's what I did when my son broke his leg while I was away for a few days.  I took him to the hospital, stitched him back up and  gave him some good advice.  He's been walking on his crutches since then.  I guess that's it.

Title: Business Transaction
 Business Transaction Dear Sir, I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN ,an Auditor at a Bank in Thailand , and an Investor/Contingent of a reputable bank here in the United State of America.I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1997, an American Oil Merchant/Contingent with the Thai Petrochemical Corporation, Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$18,300,000.00, (Eighteen Million, Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Thai Petrochemical Corporation that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$18,300,000.00 has carefully and precisely been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Thai Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Thai Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Clifford Stone so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that a lawyer will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of a reputable and honest Foreigner as a favourer and the legal agreement will be executed under my supervision and direction.The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.  If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply. Mr Ateeq Rahman KHAN

Dear Mr Ateeq Rahman Khan,

Business transactions involve varying degrees of risk- a small army of lawyers, insurance adjusters, farmers, etc. will want to come to us.  If you are interested, let me know so that I can get started.  I have started discussions with the Texas farmers market and think that it may be beneficial to have you involved.  My goal is to get a head start on filing the various forms that are due in May.

There is still some time yet- just ask the Iowa farmers market what they want and I'm sure you'll be able to help them- they were very helpful in getting me involved in the first place.  By the way, what is your address?  I'm at 339 South Florida Ave., #211, Chicago, IL 60601.  Call or write me at (773) 8 Job-search.  I'll be glad to help in any way that I can.

Love, Dad

p.s. Dad, what's the matter?  I feel like I've been abandoned by the church.  I just got back from a trip to Mexico and I'm still in a funk over what I did.  I'm still in the car and getting into the apartment complex.  I'm not sure I can get back to Chicago before lunch.  I might be able to help around the home stretch.  I just don't know- yet.

 Mr.  
 
 I have been in contact with TD Bank and Canada West to inquire about  this transaction.  They informed me that due to a change in ownership, and without their prior concurrence, this was not done.   Therefore, they need to receive a certain amount of information in order to  make a determination as to whether this is in the best interest of the  bank and its shareholders.  If you and Mary feel strongly about this transaction,  please call me ASAP and I'll do my best to convince  you otherwise.  I call only when I have serious concerns, and that's usually  around Easter.  Otherwise, I try to take vacations.  I can't remember the number of  weeks, but I assume it's some time in late August/early September.  Not today, because I'm already  working on another concern.  
 
 I call you again in a few minutes to set up the conference call.  If you don't have time to attend, please  leave a message and I'll return to you ASAP.

 Greeting in the name of our dearest friend Dear Friend This letter may come to you as a surprise since it is coming from someone you have never met before.  However, it is coming from a reliable source; I have decided to contact you based on the news report of The Nigeria Stock Exchange. I got your contact address from a business directory in Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry where I discovered that a deceased business partner of mine, Mr. James Nimely, had left the country. He had until his death in a private plane crash landed in Johannesburg, South Africa on the 3rd of October 2003.  He died with his family on the 31st of May 2004, and the case of the missing million six hundred thalers has been traced to his South African Business Bank (S.A.B) branch in Johannesburg, South Africa.  The money was generated during a boating excursion on the 8th of April, 2000, and is presently in my branch. An enquiry was therefore opened regarding possible business associates, and among those whom the enquiry referred for further investigation were:(a)a Foreigner, (b)a South African National of Late Mr James Nimely.(c)a Mr. Richard Gubu. After further investigation, it was discovered that (a)all the deceased partners in the business, (b)all Late Mr James Nimely's listed next of kin in the South African Business Law, (c)all his Business transactions were made with foreign accounts, and (d)the money will be  lost to the Government if not claimed within the next ten official working days. In order to avoid this development, my colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased partner, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by us for the funds to be released in your favour as the beneficiary next of the estate.

Hi everyone!  My name is Jean Segada and I work for  Tiscali Investments Management, LLC. I was in Houston last night for a seminar on  energy advisory  services.  This is a key issue and I wanted to  give you a heads up so you can get involved.  The seminar was  held last night at the Hyatt Regency.  About 95% of the attendees were from out of town and the general  consensus seemed to suggest that we will not be hosting  the seminar again.  I was  going to give you a heads up about the  seminar I am holding for the oil and gas industry (more specifically, about  seminar registration).   I  reserve the right to refuse to process certain registrations  (for example, I wouldn't let you into my hotel).  I usually process them for me, but if you have a special  request, please get me to do it.  The fee is $35 for 12 months  and I have always paid it before.  Unfortunately, the  seminar is a part of an Ontario initiative  that was really only recently  launched.   I  don't believe that Alberta is an ENRON jurisdiction, so I had to  find out if the program could be implemented in Alberta.  Unfortunately, the people at Tiscali  were not familiar with the ENRON  services and I had to ask them  questions during the first semester.    I looked forward to every aspect of  working with the affected populations in Alberta.  I hope that you will help me  implement my analysis and data collection in order to help in  this difficult time.  This process will  be in place no later than March 2001.

I have reviewed the contract and agree    with the changes made by   Son at Enron.  The key is the insertion of the   cash element.  Because the change is   not being made on a rolling   basis but rather monthly,   The timing is important to me because I want to   consider Cash Receipts with the new contract and see if we can get a   cash payment between contracts if necessary.  

Let me 
 know if you want me to 
 sign off on the new contract ASAP so that we can get started.  Otherwise, I would start discussions   with the old contract holder to see if we could get a cash payment in exchange   for the changes being made.

I got your email regarding the Broderick - Davis deal.   Jim,  Chris and Patterson have reviewed the contract and agree that it is critical to change the Company head office   location.   All we are looking for is a ""drop"" from Houston to Denver.   The Houston area code is written in the contract as 8832.    The Denver area code is written in the contract as 8532.   Please change the ""CSCOFT"" area code if you are not already registered there.   The Denver area code is written in the contract as 8532-8532.doc.      Once you have changed the code, you will need to get approval from the Finance Committee and we need to get started on that ASAP.

Dear Mrs Farah al-Hashemi:

I am sorry I missed you last night.  I have been out of the shower and my aunty noticed me in the morning and suggested I went to the lavatory.   I have never gone to the lavatory before and was a bit afraid I'd miss out.  My aunty is a lovely person and it's not like I go out with her on a regular basis.  I usually just come home  with a tray of soap and water.  She suggested I ask her to take me out dancing if I was going to miss out on a night out.  I was going to ask my dad about  getting into a nightclub and if he was going I thought I'd ask him why  it took so long to get into a club.  I was going to tell you about my plan to go out with a girl I know and had a bit of a falling out with my ex-girlfriend.  It's not something I've really talked about with any new people and had a hard time coming to terms with how I felt about it.   I was going to ask you how things went down the last time we went out.  I didn't want to be a bother but I was so broke up over it all that I couldn't be bothered to get into the club.   I was going to ask you why you were so upset and why it was the least I could do was go out with a girl I know and have a good time.   My best friend from school is getting married June 25 and we're planning on getting married in a few months.   We'll still be young but I feel like I'm much closer now than I was when we broke up.   We'll still be in touch but I'm not going to spend all my time with you.   I love you guys but I'm not going to spend my life with you.      I love you all, but I'm not going to spend my time with you.         I love you guys love you, but I don't plan on spending my time with you.  I just one night.

Dear reply:

Thank you, this is urgent ...  I have a meeting with ADEQ tomorrow (i.e. Tuesday the 17th) and a train will be arriving from Dubai at approximately 3.30 (exactly 3:30) ... so please get this urgently ...  I will get this information right  to my attention (i.e. it is urgent, I need  this ASAP). I will give you a tour of the facility (it is quite large) and then (in exchange for instant access to all your other financial information) you will get an ID via email. (That is all you need to know)  ID verification is automatically generated for each transaction and there is absolutely no way to prove your identity to anyone other  than me.  ID verification is done on a case by case  basis.  If by some miracle you could prove your identity to me I would absolutely love to do it.   ID verification is completely unnecessary and is performed on a case by  case basis.  If for whatever reason there is any dispute about your  identity with ADEQ it is completely avoidable ... you can log in today and try to resolve the issue.  This process is currently only available  to those who are  already verified in the system.  Any attempts to abuse this process and trick  us into granting you special dispensation is  completely unacceptable.  You cannot trick me into granting you unfettered access to my system and  then leave me be ... I can't help it, I have to respond to you immediately.     I can help you with an ID by looking at your passport, but that is not an option because I do not own  your passport.   You can, however, get me all the passport information you need by sending an email to my  mail box.   You can also get me all the passport renewals and changes of address information you need by  visiting my website at passport.usembassy.gov.tr (This web site is in English  and the French and German versions are available for your  consideration).  We need to immediately begin the initial review and verification of all of the information that is contained within your passport.   This process should take approximately 3 weeks to complete.  By the way, I have been out of the office  office since April 16th so the credit is there anyway I can look at your status for free during that time period.

Dear &quot;davidwilson2@zwallet.com.ts

I apologize, I thought this had been resolved.  Please provide me with an estimate of how long it will take to resolve your other  pending issues such as your children.    I need to know  ASAP how much longer it will take to resolve some issues with your children  and I need a clear heading start on those. 

I appreciate your reasonable caution with this proposal.   If your child is a legal resident of  England, or Wales, their parents should have received instructions setting  up that country to receive the E.B. (see below).   However, because this is a UK initiative, our  legal representatives are in the difficult position of explaining to non-UK  legal residents that this initiative is only for them, and they must be  subject to the same stringent registration, reporting and financial management requirements as  resident  England, Wales or Scotland.  We have already had two legal residents  who quit because of this requirement, and we cannot start from scratch.  You have been  very helpful in resolving this issue.   I now have instructions that will direct my team  towards how we need to resolve this issue.  We need to have a solid plan B in place ASAP so that our  legal team can focus fully and impartially on this issue.   This legal resident has never been a  part of the Enron family, and we do not want to turn that around.  By default, they are no longer legal residents of  England, so any changes in their status will be temporary,  and they will get back to normal soon enough.   We need to ensure that they are filing their income tax returns  as soon as possible, to be completed in time to participate in  the FE country exchange program.  They will be  required to file that return no later  than January 27, and we want to start preparing for that date before then.   We need to determine, from our limited  evidence, that the UK legal resident will have a hard  time making it through the January 27 transition, and we may never see them  again.   If you and  your family are interested in meeting with this individual, or in  following up on his previous contacts, please contact me ASAP so that we can continue working on this  issue.    This individual is very interested in pursuing a J-1 visa, and we need to get  something done before that process is complete.  I would prefer to meet

I suggest we talk first.   The second part of the  process is taking longer than expected because of the volume of  work that needs to be done.   We need to speak with this individual  and his team about the most
 delay  related to the E.B. process.   I would like to get the progress report  and the reason  behind the delay.   Once we have all that information,  we can work together to set up the correct procedures for  meeting with this individual and his team.   I have already spoken to this individual  and his team about the urgency of the process and their willingness to work.   I believe they have established  strong relationships with other HR folks throughout the organization.

Dear Mrs Farah al-Hashemi:
 
 I have heard that you are involved in an interesting project.  Your company, TecTip, has won a couple of contracts with Petro Canada and will soon be getting another one with Chevron - Texaco.  Your involvement with these companies is mutually beneficial - your experience making them comfortable and the training you have provided their technical staff will be beneficial to them. 
 
 Unfortunately, your involvement with these companies is not without its problems.  First, some contracts are very specific in nature and require specific approval.  Your involvement with these companies is therefore limited to that which is defined by your employers.  For example, our friend the Calgary Firm (Calgary, Alberta-based) are looking for a Chief Compliance Officer and he or she should familiarize yourself with the contract processes and issues that are specific to this company. 
 
 Your contract expertise is definitely needed - why not apply for a company drug contract if you have some contract-writing experience under your belt? 
 
 Alternatively, you could apply for a limited liability company drug contract if you are familiar with the various insurance company structures.  These are generally more advantageous to us since we do not have to worry about individual policy holders having policies with different companies. 
 
 If you are not already involved in development, then your involvement would be beneficial in two ways.  First, your ongoing mentoring and mentoring programs can be extremely beneficial to our company since it is through these programs that we have been able to attract talented individuals such as yourselves.  Additionally, your ongoing efforts to increase the number of women in management positions throughout the organization can be very beneficial to our company since it is through these positions that our women employees are contributing to our company culture and earning the respect of their managers. 
 
 If you are interested in contributing to either of these endeavors, your contributions would need to be in the form of time-limited stock options that vest over a period of up to one year at a time or in the form of cash grants that vest in annual installments.  Contributed stock options are currently only granted to certain employees, former employees and their spouses.  Employees must complete a certain series of activities to contribute to contribute to the plan and qualify for stock awards.  Grants are not given to certain applicants who is the plan's employees or to whom.  Non-  Plans also very limited to what level of the plan - no contribution cap  there is available to plan contribution.  Plan contributions are based on a plan

Title: Re: Re: GOOD DAY.

Dear 

We are very sorry to bother you, but our  son broke his arm while I was away on business.  It was not very serious, but it was  very scary.  I have been out of the country for the last  two weeks, and my wife is back in the house from her  honeymoon.  We just found out yesterday that we are  not mailing our check until July 22.   I guess we can call it a half  year, since it is just a confirmation that we are  not mailing the check until the 20th.   Who's on the 20th and who's on the  29th?    I will give you a call and maybe we can work out the  date.   I need to get back to you ASAP, however, since I am  working on a project right now that involves a trip to San Antonio and an  interscholastic football game.   I will call you again on Friday,  May 22.   Who's coming?   If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.    Thank you,  Mila

Dear MR. BRIAN NEVILLE

I will call you again in about an hour,  to check on our electricity deal.  Apparently  this is another issue on which the two of you seem to agree,  that is,  the urgency of the particular transaction needs to be met before the due diligence step should be taken.  I was under the impression that you did not think the urgency would be significant,  that it would pass  without much notice.  In addition,  given the nature of the transaction, the due diligence steps seem to be unnecessary,  and there may be some administrative over take required before the due diligence steps are complete.  The transaction I believe you are referring to,  the pay as you go option, which I think should have been taken about 3 months ago,  and which I am now negotiating to try to get cancelled.  You and your team appeared to agree that the situation was very dicey, and there was a disconnect between the  facts and what the docs actually showed.  I will try to get a sign off from your general counsel about whether the deal should be frozen,  or something should be done to try to salvage it.  If you and your team come to our house,  I would like to ask that you to get together, even though we are both from outside the country.  We just getting ready to go on vacation this coming summer.  I need you to be connected with some real news, historical information.  After much needed  i.

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

My name is  Percy Barnhart and I work for  Enron National Mortgage-Appraisal.   I was referred to you by my superior,  Angela, and she indicated that she wanted to  meet with you.  I had not heard from you  in over an hour.  I thought that maybe you had something urgent that needed to  be  handled.  So I  called you back that afternoon to discuss the most  urgent items in a deal that is extremely complex and  re-doing some of the steps may violate some very strict  Corp.  rules.  I was  advised by Angela that if the deal were to be re-nored, the individuals  involved would need to submit their resume, cover letter, and batch of  Tx form.  You were not referred to me by your superior as  an intermediary but rather as a source of information.  I was  directed to the appropriate official for planning purposes.   

I then called Kent Schrab with  Enron Mortgage Finance Corporation (www.energhem.com) and explained to him  that I had been referred to you in the above  manner and that I had instructed my superior to take care of this for you earlier  this year.   That you had referred to me in such a manner in the past is reason enough for me to  pursue this avenue again.

 GOLD OF URGENT RESPONSE NEEDED FROM YOU Dear Friend, My name is Dr. Charles Taylor, I am the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of the Federal Government of Nigeria in favour of contractors various times during the civilian dispensation. The original value of these contracts were executed to the tune of US$165,500,000.00 (166.500 million United State Dollars). The contracts were all awarded to two firms, one of which was actually awarded the contract, the other had its original value doubled to reflect in writing the transfer of the funds to the foreign account of the other firm. The original value of these contracts were then transferred into the foreign account of the contractor, who in turn, transferred the funds to his personal account in the United States. Details will be given to you as soon as you reply. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply.   = |DTD|From: DR. CHARLES TAYLOR.

Dear Dr. Charles Taylor

I have already gotten permission from the owner of the land to build a golf course and he is wanting to move his legal stuff there by the end of the week. My advice would be to talk with the city solicitor about this request. He is clearly out of the office on Thursday which defeats the whole purpose of getting legal advice. So, my call would be to call him back ASAP and to work out a time when he will be available to look after his legal stuff.

He has in his Account in my Bank the sum of $20 million. I have  successfully executed a Wholesale deposit of this amount in a security company here in South  Africa for the purpose of investment purposes only, however, due to the political unrest in my country and  other  countries in Africa, the Government is clamping down hard on any business, family or individual that is suspected of  supporting the opposition party, this has resulted in many people's deaths. Please I request in  this business, if you wish to invest this money in your country,  you will need to give me a detailed statement of your interest on  my terms and condition of employment, to enable us start immediate investment relationship.  I am aware of the international sanctions organization and some of my countrymen have been put  in jail for their alleged involvement in the illegal seizure of our Government Funds. To this effect I request permission to have the money and associated assets out of my country immediately,  as I have declared that these funds is not to be used for personal use, it is  to be used for investment in your country, I will be very happy if you take my offer as stated below.

If your boss says you're under contract and  arbitration is out, then you are.  You can file to get your money  under there.  My understanding is that an arbitration ruling is what  you send in, but there may be some negotiation involved.   You want  to make sure we're both getting the arbitration in order,  because if we are, then it's over in a few  days.  We can't be sure until Friday, when the settlement conference call is set up  between the sellers and buyers.   I need  information ASAP so that I can make the call and make the payments to both parties.   I need  to know, ASAP, whether or not my efforts will help  with the settlement process.   I need to know not only about the issues themselves, but also about how my efforts  will impact the process itself.

So, with that out of the way, lets get to the issues.  We need to make some serious headway on this.  Will your phone beep when you  speak to me?  Please respond ASAP and let me know how serious of an issue this is.

Dear Dr.Kunle Owolo,

I need some help getting my sister an internship at the university. Her college is in the Atlanta, GA area and she is currently studying for her Master's Thesis. I need to know as soon as possible so that I can get her started on her next step. My age is not an issue as I am starting to feel the anxiety of an older sibling. My response times on the phone and in person are generally very good.  My reservation is for when I am going to be away for the summer. That being said, I have not been the most active member of the family for many years.  I am 65 years old now and have been with the family for about a year.  I am currently involved in an adopt a family program in which we take in a family with a disability and help them get adjusted to our community.  It is a very young family and they are definitely family.   My sister is involved in a psychology program at Ercoles which is run by the local chapter of the Salvation Army.  She is very committed to the cause and has a passion for helping others.  She volunteers with various local groups in the area and in September will be taking psychology classes for the rest of her junior year at LSU.  At LSU she will be studying under Dr. Kenneth Mitchell.  If you are interested in contributing to this family, I would love to receive it.  Your donation will be tax-deductible.  Your donation is tax-deductible if it is sent to a church or charity that will take it from there. Unfortunately, there is not much we can do to help these families in the short amount of time they have.  Even if we could, there would still be a period of time in between when they need you the most and the taxman isnt going to let you do this just to please the government.  If you are interested in contributing, please contact me now to set up a time to help them during this time. They will of course need your donation to keep the electricity running in their area.   I can also help them with an offer for a summer job placement if you are interested in contributing.  This family is sponsored by the local chapter of the Salvation Army and they are helping this family get set up.  If you are interested in contributing, you must be at least 18 years of age and able to contribute to the project.  You must be able to contribute at least $1000 per month for the family.

You took care of my sister a few weeks ago.  Can I put my name on your calendar for May 1- I already have a few months to put a few events in motion.  Can you put my name on your calendar for May 19- I have to get started on that ASAP.  Can I forward your email to someone else for legal reasons?  Can I give you a call back if you need any further information?  Please be aware that my sister is NOT a health care professional and has never before taken an action that could be considered by the courts to be ""good Samaritanism"".  She is a licensed practical nurse and has never in any way, nor will she ever again, acted in a manner that would put her in any legal jeopardy.  Also, I do not and would never want my parents, or anyone else for that matter, to have to go through what I am going through.  I will do my best to make sure this never happens again.  Please let me know if I have violated any laws by not having contacted the family within the last 48 hours as this could result in serious consequences.   I will contact you again within the next week to set up a time frame to send my sister legal papers for May 1st.   I must remind everyone that even if you contact the family directly, it is important that they have their lawyers and an account with Enron.  Because May 1st is a new start for me, and I have new start for my parents, I have begun working on legal paperwork for April 1st.  This process has been going on for quite some time now and I am sure you will help my parents in any way that you can.   Thanks again for your help.

Dear Frank Bello:

I appreciate your concern for my well-being.  Unfortunately, my health is beyond  salvage.  Not only has your worry about my well-being contributed to my unhappiness,  it has also hindered my ability to do my job with care and concern for others.  My days as a trader in CRE's real estate market are numbered.   You have always shown concern for me and my family, even when things didn't go your way.  You have always believed in my abilities and have worked hard to earn that confidence.  I owe you that.  My goal as your employer is  to provide a high-quality, reasonable job to an employee with a passion for the   trading business.  This is very different than what I ever believed was the case.   I was an energetic, confident young man eager to please my boss and improve my   position in life.  That is not the case anymore.   I wish I could help people  with my positive energy and optimism.  That is what really matters.   I am  not interested in arguing with people about what is or isn't a good time to  go to school, or what my schedule is like.  Those things don't matter when I get involved in a fight with my boss, or when I feel like giving money to my  estranged wife.   I would never do those things.   Instead, I try to help people  with issues in their lives, usually through positive reinforcement in the form of a constructive criticism.   My hope is that this new relationship will help  people make peace with their problems and move on from bitterness to love.   I have always wanted to be your partner and co-worker, not your enemy.   I hope we can find a positive energy in this relationship that will help  people to heal and stay positive.   If you feel that I'm not serious about the fight, maybe you would be interested in discussing this with  someone else.  I would love to be your partner and co-worker, but I need to focus on this fight.   I need  to focus on this fight and on my schoolwork first.  I need to focus on my schoolwork because this weekend will be critical in my preparation for the SAT test.  My co-worker Paul is taking the ACT to LSAT prep and also took the ACT to get into the SPRINT program.   We will need to have our work cut

 This is part of a larger project to develop a portfolio of options that are comparable in size and  risk profile to existing options but with a high degree of  separation.  This is the result of extensive discussions with our  trading counterparties,  mortgage bankers, attorney  brokers and others.  This project has gone through a number of incarnations over the  past several months and has undergone significant changes.  We have made some real  progress and are currently in discussions with  several parties regarding various aspects of this project.  We believe that this is the time  for many parties to come together to make this project a reality.  We have a couple of  concrete actions that I am taking that will provide additional scope and time  for this project to complete.  Please keep me updated on this project as I will need additional time  to investigate additional transactions or sit down and have discussions with  Plunkettor and others regarding this project.  This project has  always been about more than just signing sales to financial transactions. "	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0098.png			Machine

Hi,

Just an FYI. My priority at the moment is going to be to get the *urgent* help we need ASAP to make our financial situation work.   As for the urgency of this situation... It's getting really out of hand.  Our *assistant* (i.e., me) is literally putting the person in *freeze* on his or her calendar.  On top of that, our business isn't going to work out as a result of this situation.  Our *assistant* is irresponsibly irking *me*.  It's hard for me to believe I'm doing this.  My sister found out about it when their son was in the car.  I'm not trying to get him to go out there and do *something* crazy.  I'm just trying to give him a chance to turn his life around.  If he's going to turn his life around and do something *cool* for *me*, then he should do it now.  My priority right now is going to be getting my financial help ASAP so that we can make some plans to turn *our* *assistant* into a *millionaire*.    By the way, how's your job situation?  Is everybody still *working*?  You *were* my legal adviser, right?  Yeah, I hear you got a **licensee* to go to work for *exactly* *the same rate as the person *you're *protecting*.  You can go out and *marry* anyone you want.  Really, though, you're *protecting* me.  You were my *legal adviser*, weren't you?  How's your **life**?  I *was* your legal adviser, wasn't you?  How's your **life* now?   

You might be wondering how I *owe** this debt to start with.  Well, my *free time* is just *not* being given to you right now.   And if you *had* noticed, I've been **in no way** spending *that time*.  We *had* a baby nearly 6 months ago, and it was *really* complicated *with very little in the way of a payment due.*)  What *I am doing now is *absolutely** *NOT* *being given *to you*, and you *are* getting *me**.

We discovered over the years that some of the top officials of the African Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank have been driven out of the bank since no man has been able to  remove them from office. This left us with the problem of how to transfer the money to a safe account abroad. To this end, we have in our  control the sum of USD$15 Million (Fifteen million united state dollars).We are now in  the bank's waiting room awaiting instructions to move the funds out of the South African.

There is practically no risk involved because all the documents covering the deposit  are with the South African Reserve Bank (S.A.B).

I finally got  my son back on time (he was out of the country), but he was late getting  his college admission.   I am pretty sure he was accepted into the  school, but he was so late that he had to take  an early entrance.  For all intents and purposes, he is my son.  I can  see where he is now, and I know he will be a  big help in the future.  I am leaving from work, and I am coming home  early, so I am not going to spend too much time with him because I am only going to be  going to dinner and a movie.

Hi, I hope this is your  day.  It  sounds as though your family and I have been through quite a few  difficult times together.  It seems that all parties have wanted to make child support  payments and my mom doesn't want to do them until she receives what she wants.     My step father is an account manager for an engineering firm that has  not yet hired an attorney.  He has been living in an assisted living facility for the past 3  months.  He is now looking for a new home.  I convinced his mom that  unless he went to class or  worked up an alphanumeric code, we wouldn't  have enough time to get everything done before the end of the  month.  He has started to feel left behind.  Sometimes I feel like throwing stones at"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0103.png			Machine

Dear Taofeek Ebrahim:

Sorry, I have your letter but I do not have any relevant information regarding you and the children.

If I could give you a quick call and then you could reach out to the other members of your family, including my wife, to see what was going on. But I was concerned about your reaction if you received a dirty shock during the week.  You have been clean for almost two years now, so you should not be concerned. However, I have you received much dirty laundry list?  You should be feeling bad? Listening to me? You don't you?



Call me if you need anything else.

Elbert,

I was out of the office  today and my older child was just  pulled out of Kindergarten  with a ""kneebone"" and a ""poncho"".  The ""kneebone"" is for his first  unsupervised outing.  His older  child is used to using the ""playpen"".  What is wrong?  I understand that it is only a matter of  time until he gets out on his own.  Is it too late to change his diapers?  How do you plan on getting him an education?  Why do you want to take his car away from him?  When will he get to go to school?  How many times have you parked your car in front of my house and then looked  inside and wished you would take him outside?  It is very upsetting to think that you would do such a thing.  You are not supposed to do that.  You've never tried to stop me from going to work.  You know I can't because my job  is in Kindergarten.  You might want to ask your parents about this before you try to ban me.  I will gladly give you a talk about what has and  will not happen if you do this.  I will happily take responsibility for this child because I have raised  this child myself and know what it is like to lose him.  I will take responsibility  for making sure this never happens again.

Please try to let me know ASAP if you can help.  I need to know  ASAP if I can count on you to be a source of comfort or angering my older son.  I need  to know  this is not going to be an ""us versus them"" mentality.  I can't allow this to"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0104.png			Machine

I am very sorry that this has been a stressful past two weeks for  me and our son.  Since we made the offer  on Friday, we have been discussing whether or not to accept it.  My wife is very upset about not receiving any reply  from her in the UK.  We will be sending an overseas  delivery member to collect our belongings.  Our  son will be 18 months old.  Please try to let me know as soon as possible if you agree to  the settlement and what your plans are for the rest of the tourney season. I need to  plan to get back to the settlement asap because the tourney is just around the corner.  Also, I just received a call  from my friend in the UK who is  interested in meeting us for lunch or dinner to settle the score.  We need to get this straightened out  with our UK correspondent ASAP so that we can send the payment to him.  You  can reach me at either my  home or at work.  I need  to get this straightened out very, very soon.   Please advise on what  to expect and try to let me know as  soon as possible if we will be able to settle this out.   Thanks.

I'll  call you again in about an hour to make sure we are on the same page.  By the way, how is your son doing? Is he still in preschool?   I'll just have to give him a little stick- update on his  test scores and what his GPA was last year.  That should get him a couple of solid years  dedicated to  pencils and paper.   After I send that to him, I want to get together and sketch out some  concrete steps we need to take to get there.  Can you call me back with some concrete steps we took  during the  winter months?   Also, can I get a copy of my wife's NCL  form? It is important that we get this in place  before June 1st so that we can get  our child support  into place prior to that date.   If you want to get together and talk about this issue,  this is the time to do it!   I want to get this in place  so that we can get started on it before June 1st.   Thanks.

Hello, My name is MR.AARON W.G., a member of the Sierra Leone Mining Contract Review Panel (SCMC) and a member of the panel set up by the Sierra Leone Ministry of Mining and Social Services to supervise the review and approval of all foreign contracts, especially those of large capital nature awarded to foreign contractors.  I got your company contact through the South Africa trade and industry, and after going through your files, I discovered that you have a client who is a foreigner (A Russian national of well to do family) and an investor in a company here in Nigeria which is a mining company. He died in the Kenya air crash, and all his properties were totally destroyed.  He has a total sum of $17,500,000.00 USD (Seventeen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only) in a holding finance company in Europe.  The owner of the account, while he was a national resident here, died intestate without providing any next of kin or relations.  The policy of the finance company is that such amount should be shared as follows: One per cent (totalling USD$1,000,000.00) for the foreign contractor, and three per cent (TWENTY ONE MILLION POUNDS UNITED STATE DOLLARS) for the local government and the minority community.  The policy of the finance company is that such a transaction will be thoroughly investigated and found wanting, to avoid any appearance of impropriety.  I will appreciate if you keep this business within your limits of the law as my client was a national and resident here and his death was a result of a motor accident.  If you are interested, please reply to the enclosed letter and include your private telephone and fax numbers for more details/ discussion.  I have very much interest in this business transaction, please include your private telephone and fax number for further discussions and direct messages. Awaiting your urgent response.

Dear Mr.Arnold  Gonzaga:

I have spoken to the person who originally laid the business card out to receive the money. She wanted to put it in a safe place so that  it wouldn't be misused.  As soon  as we receive the money we will send it to her.  Unfortunately, the place she  wanted to send the check to was in disarray due to the fire.  She was calling the store owner to get the address of the depository.  Unfortunately, the owner was out of the office  today so we had to send the check directly to his office.  It is his sincere pleasure.  He is very upset about not receiving the money  he paid for this weekend.  He called earlier in the week and said he would give them  a call to get the transaction tax credit.  Unfortunately, this is not an item on  the hotlist so he is  unable to make the call right now.  He may want to go to Woodbury  today and beg them to expedite the matter.  Meanwhile, we want to make sure the issue is not left for later   On Saturday, June 7.  That is when the real work begins.  We want to identify who our biggest customers are and figure out  how we can cut their business off of the list.  It is important to our long term future  plans that our natural gas contracts are in place to benefit our  customers.  We need to cut through the red tape in the natural gas  world to make that happen.  It is important that we have you on   Redbook ASAP so that we can get this off of the  calendar.  We have also identified 5-40 customers who may get screwed if  the above transaction is finalized.  These customers pay a huge price in lost sales and cash  deficits due to the above-referenced unfavorable swap data.  These customers pay the ultimate price in  diesel trade-ins and maintenance outages.   We need to identify and handle these outages  quickly in order  to provide our long term strategy in place to maximize head off the negative CTC implications   that  will result from this potential transaction.     We need to identify and patch-up these customers current hot links and waitlists in order to ensure that they remain relevant as the negative CTCA&M winds down.  we head to AP has.  move toward zero tolerance and zero tolerance.  These customers become more frequent.  This

Dear kenneth george

Thank you so much for the urgent help. I actually just got a new offer from the head of GE who is interested in  opening branches in your area.  Unfortunately, he is only interested in  GE contractors.  I have been told by a GE renter that his income is too great to accept the GE offer and  I have to go to work for free.  How are my options?  If you are interested, please contact me.  If your not,  contact another banker or ask  someone  else.  It is very unfair that after  signing a lease for a new building, we don't start moving stuff  around until the lease ends.  It is very confusing because we  originally signed a lease with GE but changed our minds and are trying to get a new  lease.  The new building is much bigger and much older than the old one.  It is quite a ways from my house so I can't  remember exactly how many months in.  I remember being picked up at the airport a couple of weeks ago because my sister was having a  baby and my mom took care of me.  I was actually in the car with  my  girlfriend at the time when this all happened.  It is really hard to fathom but it is really not my place to  complain.  I was pretty messed up because of all the drama that was going on in my life at that time.  Basically, I am trying to get my life together so that I can be with  my girlfriend asap so that I can get this all out of my system and let it all sink in to the  real world.

Title: CONFIDENTIAL
 CONFIDENTIAL Dear Friend, My name is Mohammed Zuba, the chairman of amaBJ plc and an auditor of a reputable bank here in Nigeria. I have urgent and  business-like business proposal for you. On June 6, 1996, an American mining consultant/contractor with the Department of Energy, Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address, but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigeria Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds in a bank here in Nigeria so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be kept aside for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:megan_zuba01@yahoo.com Thanks and my regards. Dr.Mohammed Zuba

Dear MOHAMMED  ZUBA:

Thank you very much for the quick response. I had a  chance to catch up with him afterwards and he  told me that he had accepted the offer and would be sending the contract  along shortly. So we went our separate ways. It was very emotional  for me to hear about her death.  How could it be  that bad?  How could my son have  lost so much love and trust?  

It is very upsetting to hear the news.  My thoughts and prayers are with your family and  the people of Nigeria at this time.  It is very hard to believe  that this is the kind of country we want to leave  and come back to.  My thoughts and prayers are for your family and  the people of Nigeria at this time.  I want to  go to school in Lagos and am looking for a way to get  myself and my son into a good university.  My efforts are not in vain.  We can and will succeed and be  very happy together.  I will take a couple of days off to visit your family and  then we will be back on Monday.  Hope you can forgive me for  not being able to get back to you with the results of the  tests I have had ordered.  I have notified the  insurance company regarding this issue and they will help  you as best they can.  You have been wonderful. I am very thankful  and very appreciative.    I will let you know as I learn more and more about the  situation.    As for today,  go out and have fun.  It  will be easier said than done.     I still have to pay the phone  bill and that is a lot to  take on.  My son has had a hard  time adjusting to life in the  present.  We will get along great medical bills  and will probably even  have some free  lunch on Sunday.  I am very excited about getting out of  here  and starting over. My son and playing sports is a lot of it. So I have no problem giving you a few  reminders just one thing  - try to do - and you. I will gladly give you a couple of my phone numbers if you need a couple of a couple of things to help with.  that. I am out of course.      I have never asked you need it.

There is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this account again.

The owner of this account is Mr. Baggio the son of late Adonis Baggio a miner of gold and a real estate agent to the port city of Accra, Ghana.In the year 2000, he died leaving behind no WILL.

I discovered that the deceased had no next of kin and that is why I am contacting you to assist in receiving this money into your account. If you accept to assist me and make application that will make you the next of kin to the deceased. I will need you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the next of kin. Once the money has been received and approved by the Attorney I will send to you by fax to open a banking account in your name.

Dear Mr. Trevor B. Hinton:

This has been a very interesting process.  My brother was very upset that my parents didn't call him back within a few hours.  Is it because of work?  I can't think that it is a good idea to call in the morning and find out your plans.  Or is it just not in your nature?  Who's been the bad boy this whole time?

Your parents have been extremely understanding and I know this has been a very difficult process for them.  But I am here for you as a means to try to make sense of this difficult decision.  I can't help but to be a jerk sometimes at work because of this.  One day when I go up to the management and give them a detailed explanation of why I chose GE, what I was trying to accomplish and why I wasn't able to,  they call me in the morning and say they will try again.   This process of trying to understand has been great.  We have a team of seven people in a building for three full days straight.  This is a lot to take in, but we have to start from scratch.  We are trying to decide what our strategy will be at this stage.  I would be happy to answer your questions, but I need this information ASAP so I can continue to work on this strategy and on developing our relationship.   I will be out tomorrow with my wife and we have our son tomorrow off days off.     I need to get back on Tuesday and get this process finished up to GE so I can get set up to date asap.

Dear, I am Mrs. Mary Ann Kabiula, the wife of former President of  President of Republic of Liberia, Emile Kabila. I am writing to you in respect of US$2,000,000.00 (Twenty Million Two Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars). This money was deposited by my late husband in a high risk foreign country,  for safe keeping.  Because of the new administrative law in my country, all the Banks have direct access to my account.I told you that this fund will be released in your favor after you help me to  receive the fund in my account. Since I had lost so much money trying to transfer this fund to a reliable Foreign Agency. Now that I have realised my mistake and released the fund to your care,I would like to seek your assistance in investing it in your country or invest it in your country as you may advise me. Please kindly allow me to borrow some money from you for investment purposes. When I received your reply, I will give you all the procedures to try and help me to lift this money out of your country. Please also send me your telephone and fax number; this is to enable me give you the contact of the foreign Agency where we can receive the fund. I will then forward your name as a beneficiary and the fund to your foreign account, within ten banking days. The process is simple and we have mutually agreed that 20% of the total money will go to you for your assistance while 80% will belong to me. You should note that this transaction is risk free, because the fund is in a private, safe and secure account with no trace in the world.

Dear Mr.Davi Aluko:

My wife received an interesting card and on Saturday we went out for BBQ ribs.  Her brother was supposed to be there, but she had to go.  On Sunday we went to the Oktoberfest and my wife got to be the butt of several jokes.  Our son had a football game and the kids were so excited that they got to spend the night with their fathers.... It was so wrong when it didn't go our way.

But mostly it was painful.  Because I have not been to visit my family in a few weeks, I decided it was time to call my sister-in-law and inquire about a business meeting she was planning.  She was supposed to give me a call on Monday, but now it looks like I might have to meet with her face-to-face.  I will try and call again on Friday to make sure all is well.

We will, of course, discuss what kind of meeting we would like to have with my family, but I wanted to first talk to my family before I made a decision.  Being a part of a dual-income family, I do not have very good insurance coverage.  My wife has had it with regards to our oldest child (aged 6), but we have settled for having one child (a son aged 7) and raising him as our only child.  It is not a problem that we have, though, because we still live in a two bedroom apartment and have an accessible car.  We are trying to figure out how to build equity within our family without resorting to child support.  We are still paying off the student loans that our eldest child took on, as well as our oldest son's medical school loan.  Fortunately our oldest son is not nearly as dependent on student loans as he was at age 15, and we have been making some fairly decent monthly deposits into our son's account.  We have also added in a couple of lines of credit, one with a term of one year and the other that is term-only.  While these are not ideal, they work well in the short term to try to build some equity in our family.

We will be in the office on Wednesday for a conference call regarding our student loan.  If you are available to help us with this, please call me asap and I will hook you in!  I will also be out on Thursday for the Memorial Day weekend.  If you are not available that weekend, then try to

Title: Re: Re: Business Invitation From Mr.Davi Aluko

Thanks for the invitation.  I'm trying to hook up with my cousin in California from England for a business meeting.  She is in her late 20s and from what I've gathered from her LinkedIn profile, she attended Hampshire College and worked in various capacities there.  She graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Business Administration.  She is currently employed by Enron in London and was recently selected to work in Customer Success Management there.  Her main area of interest is in SAP and SaaS programs, and worked on several projects there.  She has completed a Masters in Business Administration and is currently seeking a Ph.D. in Information Technology.  She is currently the business editor for Enron Finance UK and the author of two books on the subject.  Her area of expertise is Application Development, and if you are in the London office on April Fools' Day,  please take pictures of her and send them to me.  I will then decide which ones I want her to write about.  For historical reasons, she is NOT allowing me to post  them on her blog.  

Please let me know asap if you can be available to help on April Fools' Day to give Ms. Ballard a better laugh.  I just learned about a flight that afternoon.  If Ms. Ballard wants to meet me, she will have to arrange something else.  The good news is that Ms. Ballard is sending me letters regarding Ms. Cresendo's departure, and I have been sent a draft of Ms. Cresendo's resignation.  If Ms. Cresendo wants to meet with me on  May 1, I would love to meet her.  The bad news is that June 1 is upon us and it is customary for business leaders to present  their resignation to the government.  So, Ms. Ballard is trying to figure out a way to present her resignation to the  government before June 1.  I have talked with her about it, but I think she will argue that it is in the best interest of the business  community to present this document to the  government now in order to fully understand the  ramifications of her actions.  Plus, she wants to put some historical context behind Ms. Cresendo's  resignation.  Ms. Ballard has asked me NOT to use her actual name, but rather her middle name, so I have decided not violated any rules by not putting Ms. Cresendo's name forward in the document.

The package arrived today and I was at home with my son when I got the package. My son went out Tuesday with his tennis...I told him it was only for Tuesday. I don't know what happened but I just wanted to be certain that the next package would not be stolen.

I opened the package and found a note from Elizabeth in Pompano saying that there would be no problem opening the package. I then looked at the note and found out that she did in fact open the package but gave me a strange address and requested urgent help. Because of my inexperience with the internet I did not realize that portions of the document were missing until I traced my computer. I then found out that portions of the document were missing because I typed them in a hurry and then redid them. I am very sorry that I did not find out sooner about the missing sections.

Title: URGENT MESSAGE FROM JOHN
 URGENT MESSAGE FROM JOHN ATTN:SIR/CEO I am writing you for a business transfer of a huge sum of money. Though I knew all along that this money would be a source of stress and confusion for both of us because I have dealt with these people myself. I am a businessman by training and my business has flowered in the last ten years. My client, late Mr. Al Nasser, an Iraqi refugee ,officially became a citizen of Iraq through the action of a United Nations aid worker, and was a contractor with one of the government parastatals. He was until his death a ingress and egress through Iraq to China. Before his death he called me and informed me that he lodged some money with a security firm in DAKAR the total sum of USD$10 Million (Ten Million United States Dollars)in a box as a family treasure.When war erupted between the Iraqi Government and the United States of America in the wake of the change of the US President involving the participation of some Western military personnel in the removal of Saddam Hussein from office in Iraq.We were ordered by the president to  leave the country within seven days of the instruction. I was under the impression that such instructions came from above, however I found out that such orders were given only to government officials and that there was no such undertaking as 'captured government funds' as the funds were lodged in a security and finance firm with the help of an Iraqi Diplomatic Courier Service - an arm of the government parastatals.The funds were realized from the sale of Iraqi State Assets and the military budget during the war. I contacted you based on trust to assist me in claiming and investing these funds on your behalf with your help in processing the payments and in the business of investment in your country which is a high yielding investment. Specifically, I want you to assist in investing the money in your country to a business enterprise of sufficient size for at least two years. I will guide and assist you in all aspects of the transaction, from the time of when the funds were lodged to the time when you receive the funds. I want to assure you that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to work with me, you should state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, contact me immediately on my private TEL:+31 617 899 9976,so that we can proceed with the process of investing the money.I expect your urgent response.Please, call me on my private TEL:+31 617 899 1120. Regards, Mr. John Ngo.

Dear John Ngo:

        I have been inundated with e-mails from concerned Citizens objecting to the draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) on the Alamo Drafthouse's request to build a new $100 million dollar building.  We have always said that we would not build the proposed $200 million dollar building (the tallest building in Houston) unless we had first made a decision about the $50 million dollar building (the smallest).  I would like to discuss with you asap ASAP how we would make that decision.  It needs to be 100% certain that we would not be in violation of the Houston Compromise or the State of Texas Climate Change Program.  I'd like to discuss asap with your group as we are in the midst of developing the EIR, which will be submitted to the full EPA by the ALAMO DEVELOPMENT GROUP this week.  Once the decision is made on the EPA request, we will take another look at the request and, if necessary, amend it.  Once the revised request is approved, we will send the new revised request to the full EPA and, if necessary, file documents to back up our position.  Then, we will take another look at the revised request and, if necessary, file documents to back up our position.  It's important to us that Houston is developing capacity and that the EPA is monitoring this request closely.  The revised request does not do enough to tell us when it will be time to close this deal.  The new deal the EPA is negotiating requires additional information to complete the 60 days since the last deal was signed.  The EPA has informed us that the next step is to fax all of the information we received from the previous deal to the EPA for inclusion in the final product.  This would mean that by the EPA deadline of 3 p.m. on Friday, we would have missed the deadline by a total of 60 days.  I was disappointed in this latest attempt to close the deal, as it was very vague and the terms were very restrictive.  I would like to discuss with you ASAP on how we would fill out the gaps in your group's schedule and, if needed, add on another day or two to keep this project on schedule.  My schedule is very flexible and AP starts on Wednesday, so I would like to get this in before the big monster on my schedule and see if the kids can come to us any of it.   I have time crunch time constraints

The scholarship is for each school.  Each school has been awarded one,  however, the school that finishes the season with the highest total number of scholarship recipients (one per conference) wins the  trophy.  The Foundation takes this opportunity to recognize the hard work and dedication of the  men and women who have contributed to this historic event. 

The 2018 contest will be Friday,  September 24.  College Station is trying to get an  invite for the  summer of each year, so they should be very good about this.  They already have an  excellent women's basketball team and I would think they would be interested in having a women's team as well.  The men are much  likelier to contribute to this event as well as the  other great work that goes on in and around Houston.  So, having a team of women's basketball players is a wonderful blessing and honor. 

If you are interested in contributing, you must have an  Enron.net account -  I haven't used it in quite a while, but if you are  interested, you should get the details.

 I just got a call from my sister-in-law. She says that her parents asked her to postpone the trip to  Houston because of a conference call that her and Jay are planning.  It was a very interesting conference call  (not that  particularly exciting).  So, Jay and Veronica are planning on going to Houston to  meet up with their old flame and have  a little more fun than they did back in the day.  Well, now that they  have their little girl, things are really a mess.

Title: DEAR SIR,
 DEAR SIR, From Mr. Michael Ola. Chonburi-Sierra Leone. Attn:Mr. Michael Ola. Re:Transaction/Agreement. Dear Sir/Madam, I am contacting you on a business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account that I believe you will be in a position to help me transfer out of Sierra Leone to your country or any other country of your choice where we will invest it. I have the authority of my account holder (Late) who died from the Sierra Leone epidemic. Before his death he made a will and gave to me all his property, which includes his bank account, which he declared to be $10m (ten million united state dollars)to my knowledge no other person has claimed it nor will anyone ever come forward to claim it. The government is not aware of this account because my mission is not allowed by law to be able to visit the country at the moment. A company director who has been in this business for a long time and died quietly from a heart attack in April last year told me recently that the government will not allow any British or American company to claim this account because the owner will be buried alive if he does not claim it urgently. I have been told by my account director in the past that if I do not claim this account urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. If this is the case please reply to my private and confidential box: (mariama_olela@yahoo.co.uk) for further directives of how we can move the money out of the Country immediately. If you are not interested please do not reply because I do not want to make rash decision which will not benefit us both at all. Please also reply to my private and confidential box for further directives and advice. Yours faithfully MOBUTU KONA

Dear Bobby:   My dear brother in law passed away a few days ago.  My thoughts and prayers are with you at this difficult time.  We are doing well.  My mother is back in the life and I am  doing very well as well.  I have been going to the doctor and up to 12 different specialists to try and find a cure.   I finally gave birth to a son yesterday which was rough but it was worth it.  I will write again tomorrow and hopefully find a cure I can send a picture of.   I love you all very much and will miss you all much.   My Dad is moving to Houston soon and it has been great to see how he has changed.  He is staying with my mother in law in the old  house which has always been a comfort and refuge for us.  The views you guys provide are always beneficial to the cause and I am  grateful for your kind words.  Please feel free to contact me with questions,  concerns, or requests.

Title: Re: Re: DEAR SIR,

I'm worried sick about my investment.  Is it just me or is the market really that bad right now?  It really is sad to think that the bad times we're living through are just a memory.   Don't you think this is a lot like the bad times we had as kids.   Living in poverty,  having our home bugged,  having our cars repossessed,  having our business associate threatened,  all because of a few bad eggs.    We  just can't fathom why this market is so messed up.

What's been causing this market problems down here?  Do you think the banks will help  us out with the lease issues?  Or are we just on our own down here?  Let me know ASAP if I need to do anything  or need you guys to be there for moral support.  Obviously, you guys would love to do this job.  For your  protection, I need some real advice right now.     You guys have been my best friends back home.   They  always came back to me with  things to  do, fresh  material, new experiences, and a whole new  world.  

They tell me I'm  not doing well enough, but that's the truth.  I'm  a mess, and they think I'm  not focused enough.   I need to get my GPA up, get my ACT 3.0, and try  to impress them with what I've been  up to.   My goal right now is to get my kids into a good  school to help them get an education.   If you guys could talk me out  of something, it would be much easier  than trying to help someone like  yourself.    My best friends are all  in very similar spots.  I feel like if I talked myself out of anything, it  wouldn't be a big deal.  I would take the blame for my poor  grades, if you think I'm guilty, I feel like I've laid a  lot of blame on myself.    I'm not trying to judge you guys, I'm just  saying that I'm  not handling this well right now, and I need some serious help.  

Thanks!

Dear Fred  Adoh:  I told you earlier that I would be pleased to talk only on Saturday.  You should expect to hear from me on Monday.  If you have a call by then, please let me know.  I am taking a vacation from work commencing January 3rd.  My son has decided to take his first vacation ever.  I will be out of the loop from Monday to Thursday.  Sounds as though his school year is fairly new and much less stressful than his last year at alma.  We only have one car though.  

I just returned from a trip to Italy as that is where my son is now and we only have one child to take to school (kiddo is six months old).  Our trip was completely on hold because of a medical emergency two weeks ago.  I am so glad that your son called 2 weeks ago and said that he is interested in going to the doctor.  He said that he wants to see if there are any  other doctors or other programs that are  available that will help him.  I have to admit that I have been pretty much keeping quiet about my son's medical needs.  I have been out of the loop on a family basis as our nieces are having their  children diagnosed with a rare pediatric bone  fracture.  We are without power for about a week now and were without it for about two months because of a power outage.  My wife has recently started getting some health reports and has determined that our son is definitely on his parents  insurance and should receive some sort of compensation.  She says that his premium has increased by $100 since our last  insurance payment and we are raising children together and it is tough  to keep up with the monthly payment.  We are doing OK on the insurance front.  My oldest son just turned 19 and is in his senior year at  Southern Methodist University.  He is now the target of a new hate crime targeting Jewish people.  Our first act as mayor of  Dallas is going to be to put an end to the constant  demonstrations that are taking place all over the city.  I will be  meeting with the ADEQ today and  will be releasing the  figures related to carbon monoxide and other  emergencies to try and put a stop to this growing  problem.  It is very concerning to see the level of hatred  directed at our police officers and the damage that this city  has already done.    I have been in contact

 URGENT ASSISTANCE  Attention,  My name is Mr.  Baoh, I am in charge of Administration,HongKong branch of the CITICOBUMA CRUDE OIL SU. I discovered through my personal research that you might be interested in receiving some assistance from me in your business.  At the heart of my present predicament is the sum of about $25 Million USD. I discovered this money in a secret vault in one of the banks here in HongKong.  I have duly notified the bank of the discovery of this fund in accordance with our protocol, and also the discovery of other similarf     totalling in excess of $25Million US Dollars.  The bank   immediately took possession of the money and kept it there for our personal use, but presently, I find it is not safe to associate  with  any of my present colleagues anymore because I discovered this money, which belongs to my colleagues, in their accounts.  I will be entitled to 10% of the total fund as compensation for my  services, 1% for miscellaneous expenses, and 70% belong to my family and I.  Please kindly dispose of this money in accordance with the instructions given to you, I have  received and examined all the necessary documents to enable me make this claim.  All I require is for you to reach me immediately through my confidential direct fax number +27-83-509 9649.  I have all necessary legal documents for the claim, I am awaiting your urgent response.

Dear Mr. Michael Gallagher:

I need immediate assistance with an urgent matter. The principal at the school I work for has threatened my safety if I don't cooperate with his demand that I turn over my hard drive. He said that he will ""find a way"" to get my hard drive but I don't know how or how dangerous it is becoming. I have received a lot of threatening phone calls and telegrams regarding this issue. I have been called a terrorist, a Nazi, a pervert, a child molester and a slumlord. I have been the victim of several attempts to rape me, but I have prevailed in every attempt and have overcome them all. I would like to suggest that you set up a meeting for one or two minutes to exchange views on ways to resolve this problem. I have never been violent or a threat to anyone, but I am a peaceful person who wants to cooperate with everyone and to live my life to the fullest. If you feel that I'm not cooperating and would be a menace to everyone else, then you need to tell me. I need to know so that I can withdraw from the meeting. If you don't have time to meet today, then please don't try to bully me into it. If you insist, then I need you to propose something concrete that you think I can do. I need concrete evidence that you think I'm not cooperative and there will be consequences. If you don't have that, I need evidence that you think I'm dishonest and that you think I'm a threat to other people. I need to know so that I can withdraw from the meeting. There's no time to lose.       Mr. Mike Gallagher

Hi again,

       I thought that it might be helpful if I forwarded a document which describes some of the anomalies encountered during the course of the last 10 days.    This data includes transactions which occured while Mt. Gox was still trading and possibly even before.   Please note that the data does not take into account transfers such as those from the former ENA which probably led to some severe network problems.   This data also does not take into account short selling which is handled by Genesis, one of the Genesis trading divisions.   Furthermore, please note that transactions which occured during Mt. Gox's downtime may have resulted in some incorrect or incomplete data which was captured during the reporting period.   Lastly, please note that some of the data which is included may be outdated which is why transactions which occurred during the reporting periods are incomplete.      My apologies for any inaccurate information which may be contained in this email.

Title: Business Invitation From Mr.David Grae

 Business Invitation From Mr.David Grae Nice to receive your urgent message after a short time. I am Mr.David Grae, currently Director of Private Banking Services with a Bank in Singapore. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an American miner, Mr. Dave Graham made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for fourteen (14) calendar months, valued at US$14,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million, Two Hundred and Twenty Thousand United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, United Mine Workers United States that Mr.Dave Graham died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Dave Graham did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of $14,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expences both parties might have incurred in the course of the transaction.If this proposal is acceptable by you, please respond immediately via my private email and upon your agreement, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax  mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply Delete

Dear Mrs Farah al-Hashemi,

I need your assistance with Tanya's child. My son is five and a half and she is expecting his twentieth child on June the 1st. My work is very demanding and requires me to be available for every call and meeting with clients. I cannot leave the house at night due to my commitments, so I need to be available to meet with clients immediately. I cannot begin to fathom the demands placed on me by clients, parents, and siblings alike. At times, it is overwhelming. I have lost count of the number of times I have cried, wailed, or yelled at my computer screen, for no apparent reason other than stress. At other times, it has been the opposite; I have found solace in the fact that I have been called upon to care for ailing siblings, or to look after a sick parent. Simply put, I have been called upon to do both jobs. What has prevented me from doing these jobs fully, and what exactly do I lose out on if my obligations are not fulfilled?

I do not want my two older siblings to have to see me do these jobs, and I do not want them to have to suffer the humiliation of having to look after their parents during times of sickness. I want them to have a better life, not only financially, but also in life. I want them to have the opportunities and the freedom to make mistakes and to grow. I do not want them to be victims, I want them to be leaders in their fields. Not only that, I want them to be able to help me and my family as they did in the past. So I am emailing again, this time with an urgent request; please consider this email as confidential and only for your family.

Please do not share this email with anyone, and please contact me if you wish to discuss this further.

Thank you,

Liz

Title: Re: Re: Urgent Proposal From: Mrs.Rita Diatta.

I agree wholeheartedly. I was not in on the original draft but it was changed  very recently. I have not heard back from her as of yet but I would be more than happy to give her a call if  necessary. Please do not hesitate to call me should you have any questions. All I did was the  initial review and I gave it a pass without making any changes. If you were in on the  original draft I would have gladly taken a pass as well. However, we need more information  and a time frame to determine our next steps.  My number is  (239) 233-3306 and I will try and call you back  asap today to set up an interview schedule.  Otherwise, we will take a hard look at different dates to determine our next  steps. This process will not be an option if December 2 falls on a Saturday which would prevent us from conducting a live interview on that date.  Instead, we will take a hard  look at February 13th and 14th which will likely be the most logical dates due to their proximity to our office.  We will reassess this in the next  2 weeks as well and make a decision as to whether or not we want to go to  work on that date.  Please be patient as we work this out.  It will not be an option  once we have determined the most logical timeline.

The hard part is  not knowing  our timeline due to the small amount of time we have available  today.  Being that this is a collaborative effort, there  will be some ""gotchas"" that will be encountered due to our short  time frame.  We will work to make this process as painless and  straightforward as possible.   Additionally, we need to identify any ""dead lines"" that may exist  and work towards a resolution asap to close them.

We need to identify the best time to visit on that particular date.  Based on our discussions with the  other candidates, it appears that they are all desiring to  return to Washington DC for the  grand finale.  Since I have already accepted the offer to move  to DC, I do not believe that this is in the cards (at least formally).  I will return on January the 16th.

I will try, but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to go due to DC on January 16th unless I receive urgent ""additional information"".  I need to get"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0123.png			Machine

Hi yall

    I'll try and help  you guys out here today.

 I believe the hardest part about trying to locate employees is because of a recent layoff.  As such, I have been  trying to locate people, and have had limited success.  I apologize for this however,  it is only my second day back to the office and  I am still trying to narrow down who I should be contacting.  Let me  know ASAP if any of the above-referenced people are available.

 You may also  have already reached this location but I wanted to  give you an update on how things are coming along right now. 

Let me  know if there are any plans to move/change your shift status/hire someone different tomorrow.  I have a 6 AM phone  run (no more frequent use) and tend to be pretty indecisive about whether I do  business trips/start of work/rest days.  I just made  this announcement to our director of operations.  

I'm attaching my resume....

 MATT BUNDU VERY URGENT ATTN: SIR/CEO, I am MR.MATT BUNDU, Assistant Director of Western Union (Western Union) Asia Pacific business and finance department. This is an urgent and very confidential business proposition. On June 6, 1996, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered from his contract employers, South African Export Promotion Council that Mr.Matt Burton died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Matt Burton did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Matt Burton so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately you Telephone number, Account Number, and private e-mail address where I can lodge your family business and other requirements. 2. I will like you to respond immediately with your full names and address to this mail. 3. I will want you to send to me immediately your telephone and fax number for easy communication. 4. Send also your full names and address to enable me file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favor before i could proceed on the transfer to your account. Please acknowledge the receipt of this mail if you are interested. I expect your urgent response immediately. Yours Sincerely, MR.MATT BUNDU.

 My name is Michael Nelson and I am currently applying to become a Contract Pharmacist/Medical Doctor.  I was referred to you by Betty Cox, MD, FACCS.  I have been accepted into Tulane University School of Pharmacy where I will be working towards my Pharmacy degree in the spring of 1997.  I will be completing my program in the fall and will be leaving in the fall, so I have time to start working on my Master's in Clinical Pharmacy.  I have started my first semester  with the same professor as my predecessor.  We have very similar grading and grading criteria, so I am  assuming that you were not the only one who felt that you were not fitting in here.   Your name is not on the honor roll any longer, but I  think you deserve an award for your efforts.  I hope you can continue to help in any way that you can.   Also, I would like to inform you that I am no longer working for Western Union and am now working for Mastercard.  If you were wondering why  we are  not using Western Union for international transfers, now you know why.  You will get  very cold feet if you bring money here.  You have no idea how much it has cost us over the phone over the past couple of months.  We are very conservative people, and  sometimes that means we have to pinch ourselves because we don't have a lot of other options.   I was very upset about not having received an answer before Christmas.   I thought it would be a good time to ask you why you were  not using Western Union for those transactions.  Also, I was not sure if I would be able to participate in some of the activities  that you had planned for the trip because I was working part-time  and had to look for a job.   You must have heard, or seen, that I was able to join  something called The Tulane Alumni Foundation.   This is a non-profit corporation that raises money for both schools and gives  back to the community in some small  way.   My hope is that we can help in the search for a cure  for some  common  disease or a way to keep people on a little more  realistic  economic  expenses.   Something I have been struggling with at the moment is whether I want to participate in some of the new team activities that  are new to

 URGENT ASSISTANCE . Dear (Sherry) I fear that my appeal to you might be a sullen one, though I know that a parent ought not to cry out their child's name. I am Sarah Amaka ,the son of late former PRESIDENT of (UN* - South African)Victor Hugo Amakuma (Aza a.k.a Josef) and on the 15th of May 2003, during a coup against the elected government of my country, my father died along with my mother. Since then my mother left with her children (stuck) for (UNHCR in South Africa) Africa. I have decided to contact you because of the urgency of this transaction. My father was a shopper and he was also a diamond /cocoa dealer in Liberia. Before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged some money (US$10.000.000.00) which he made on a business trip to (South Africa) through a diplomatic means, with a security company here in South Africa. He told me that this money was to enable him invest a good part of his life in your country. I want you to help me to lodge this consignment in (UNHCR's) safe deposit box and then forward it to you for safe keeping. He told me that the security company did not know the content of the box as it was unloaded and left at my disposal with the help of my husband's former assistant. This consignment has since been lodged in (UNHCR's) safe deposit box. However, the management at the Security Company told me that they did not know the content of the box as it was left there as a family treasure. They told me that the box will be opened upon request from me at the last. When I tried to contact my late father's attorney in South Africa, he told me that he had all the necessary legal documents which prove the validity of the consignment. I am waiting for your urgent response. Please reply to my private and confidential email:

Is there anyway I can go to the  SEC prosecutor about wanting to be buried with my grandchild.   I have been living in New York for the past 8 months, and have moved back to L.A. two weeks ago.   I've decided to move back to L.A. with my wife and our three children as our first stopover.   I'll be out of the country for the rest of the summer, so I can't send my request to  the SEC for investigation.  Unfortunately, I don't have that much time remaining on my contract, so I can't request an immediate  pardon.  Even if I were an adult and could request a discretionary pardon, it would be very difficult to justify in writing.  It just would be a matter of  showing cause  and justifying my actions.  I can't do either of those things, unfortunately.   So, I am basically putting the legal fight I am having with the SEC behind me now.   I would love to be able to share with you  what I have learned about the SEC and what I can do to make your life easier.

But first, I want to talk to you about some funeral arrangements. I have some questions for you that I  have not been able to sort out yet.  You guys and I talked earlier about wanting to  take time during the week of February 4th to sort out the arrangements for your and your family's funeral.  I have narrowed down my list of  requests to three.   They are the most reasonable and I feel that if you guys could agree on  these terms, it would be a huge relief  to me and to everyone involved.   Will your forgiveness  be enough to keep me going?  My prayers are with you during this difficult time.

Love, Dad

Nelson Zureben died on 31st of october 1999 in a car accident with some of his colleagues. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay claims for his investment. I therefore made urgent arrangements to locate any of my late father's family or relations. A day or two later, the documents relating to my fathers investment came up as family of my late father were involved in a car accident, I was seriously injured in the incident, and subsequently diagnosed with traumatic myelogenous leukemia (T.M.L).

My mother and two elder brothers died in the same accident, and since then no one has come forward to lay claims for my fathers investment. I am making this request to you because of the need to involve a foreign partner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your help to help me to locate my fathers relatives and also to provide a safe account where this funds could be transferred into pending my own claim. When I made this request to you, I had no idea that you would one day contact me, and after talking with you I discovered that you are a person of great integrity and reliability, given your position in my country, I hope you will grant and co-operate with me in this business transaction. I have 3 things to ask of you: (1)To furnish me with your company's name, address, private telephone and fax number for easy communication and safe keeping of this funds in the bank. (2)To also provide an account where this funds could be transferred out pending my own claim. 3)To also make arrangement for me to come over to your country for investment.

Here's some quick information about our family.  My 7 year old son has diabetes  and can't get enough  of this wonderful thing.   My 24 year old daughter has had diabetes  for about 4 years now and it's gotten much worse.  She was supposed to get a free medical examination this summer, but  due to a ""family emergency"", we couldn't take her out of the house.  She remained in the house today, drinking  milk and  cookies, and doing push ups.  She's been doing well.  Our 8 year old son has had diabetes  for about 3 years now and it's gotten progressively worse.   At this point, his blood sugar is around 150 mg/dl, which is pretty darn good  for a child his age.    Anyways, I hope you can use this in getting some muchneeded  information about how diabetes affects us and how you, my husband, are affected by diabetes.  You and of course, weaning you to live  our children.

    Your urgent assistance will be highly appreciated. The head of the company,Bernadette Le Dain,  has been involved in a business dispute with the chief executive officer of the company,Thomas More.    When BNP was incorporated in 1997, its legal name was simply 'Bernadette Nhan' and its trading name was simply 'BNP Capital Markets'.   However, in April this year, BNP changed its name to simply 'Brooks Group'.    Since then, the business dealings of BNP have been disrupted by a number of events, most notably the listing of the company on the Toronto Stock Exchange in August and a succession of business failures, both financial and human resources matters, which have affected the viability of the company and the management team.   This situation has led to a significant change in the culture and procedures of the business and, as a result, it is in dire need of assistance.    The leadership team of BNP is, without doubt, the finest group of people in the entire world.   I am confident that your talents and experience will be of great assistance to this organization.

 I was at Jordan with Michael Meyers and talked with  them about moving up on or off of the team.  Based on what I was told they wanted to do, it was just a matter of identifying the right people and getting them  approval.  Unfortunately, Richard Sauck and I were not on the original  list and I had to start all over.    When I called Richard last night to tell him I was  going to start all over, he was confused and didn't  know what to do.  He sent me an email which I  read and which he sent along with his notes.  After giving me the first draft, Richard sent along his memos and  approval. I  then call Mike Meyers and talk to him about placing Chris Mcgowan on the team and taking a look at  his son's work.  It was pretty clear from the conversation that he wanted to do  something very similar to what Chas is doing now, but with a couple of  changes.   For example, he wants me to start looking into ways in January for  two reasons.  The first is that his contract year is coming up and the second is that his son is starting to show some  signs of life.  We want to make sure  we give him a chance to show us why HE deserves a second chance.   I will be out of the office on Tuesday,  1/21/02, so  I will have to start all over again.  I will be back after 2 months, but I will have to do so without Chris.   I guess I will be the first to vote in June on  whether Chris should remain on the team or move on.   I can't begin to tell you how thankful I am that you sent me your letter first.

Dear Yannick Vidal,

I will be out of the office on April 14. My older son (retired) and an upperclassman from another university came here on February 13. They took the Saturday visit and I spent the rest of the weekend with them. It was a really good experience and I would recommend it to anyone considering coming. My priority at this time is getting my daughter an advanced education. An A.A. is very exciting but also very intimidating. My oldest son (retired) is now an academic and started at the university as a freshman. The A.A. program allows him to continue his education while still having an active and contributing role in his family.  As for his younger son, he is studying to become a . He is currently on an accelerated three year path.   After completing his program, he will be entering the same position that he was in as a student at the university.  He hopes to one day work for  Enron and become a part of history.   My apologies for any of you that are  experiencing this right now.  It  sounds as though your son has really stepped up at this stage in his career.

Your urgent need to have   these issues resolved ASAP is exactly why I am wanting to  work with you.  Specifically,   this issue is around when Earth Resources acquired an unlimited supply of gas from   Altra and is now seeking an indemnification against   claims from its former employees who believe the acquisition was made without their prior approval.  Simply put,   the leases in question are written so that they are enforceable   (the employees agree to service the leases in a certain manner regardless of whether the lease is written in   agreement or not).  The employee's current location is also important because they may want to relocate to a new location when they are   done with   their contracts (I believe one of the key factors that determine which employees are good   to keep and which are bad is whether or not they are still eligible to receive   severance benefits).  Because the leases are written such that they are enforceable,  the employees may not want to give up their severance benefits (and the lease provides the employees with an incentive to keep them in the lease).    I want to talk with you about whether severance benefits are available for this group and   how they can best   utilize these benefits.  Can you call on Cheryl to get clarification on this point?  If you don't,  can you give me a call (801-989-272686) and I can get clarification on    the severance provisions for this particular situation.  Also,     as discussed earlier, we talked about whether or more generally, we should discuss whether or not to institute"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0134.png			Machine

Please be advised that my assistance would be focused strictly  around the June 1 opening date.  Due to the nature of the assistance I could notet bring your request  up to date on June 1 so we cannot be certain that the rates you have  provided will be accurate.  Furthermore, due to the nature of the arrangement, certain defined benefit  pensions are only provided to certain individuals and limited  coverage is provided to beneficiaries.  In addition, certain requirements are not in place to provide the  goods or services at the rates that  are consistent with the agreement.   Due to these reasons, I did not want to do this prior to  June 1 as a first approach to assure yourself and   your family that we are providing the assistance  and we are not just giving you a few more months to iron out the  details with ENA.  On June 1, however, we will begin to receive some basic  services and your response will be greatly appreciated.   We will be   working with ENA to finalize the  arrangements so that your response is as specific and  specific as possible.  April comes early for April, Liberty has a hard  time of it.   You won't believe it, But Our Lord and Savior is the one   who raised Me from nothing .........and He saved me from drowning  in a well....because March broke up our agreement.    He's the one who set this whole thing up.    You might think I am stupid for not having   gotten anything out of April 1, You don't understand....it just is not your time   and you are not my priority right now.

You guys are starting to tire of me not getting anything done.   I am starting to feel the anxiety of not having anything  done by Her due to Her not having time to care for me......or does Her favorite activity involve little finger twirling?   I always enjoyed playing with Her because Her sport was new to me and Her playing was a blast.

You have reached us within the time frame for dispatch to the UK.  Because you are now, it is imperative that you immediately commence the removal of all references to ENRON and its trading name from all business records pertaining to the area where we currently operate.  This must be completed by the end of next week for records to be de-linked and for trading to resume.  Please assist me in this regard by ASAP finishing the business practice of accounting that is currently required prior to accessing the insurance coverage that is currently standard business practice.  Once this is completed the insurance coverage will be much more readily available.  Please have your office staff contact us prior to the start of trading as we have some very strong,  pending litigation with Enron over the mis-selling of their product to the unsuspecting  general public.  This is a huge deal and our previous existence as a selling platform for Enron-branded  products was not that great.  We renegotiated the LPR terms with them in order to sell more of our own  products when they initially came to us.   The results of this process have been  disastrous.   We are now advertising for trades under our own brand but were originally  negotiating with them to be the trade marketing representative.   This position requires a great deal of  training and extensive reviewing of new policies and processes.   It is a highly demanding  position that demands a very high standard of performance.   I have been working hard at trying to land these positions but am being very hard pressed.  My oldest son turns 16 later this month and has successfully completed his first year of college.   Without admitting any faults in regard to this venture, I would have preferred to  have started this venture over a year ago.   However, as it is currently unfolding, I feel that starting this endeavor over a year ago was the correct approach.

I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1998, an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an entire portfolio valued at US$19,500,000.00 (Nineteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into one of the leading private Banks here in South Africa.  Upon maturity, the Funds was decleared Unsatisfied and was subsequently conveyed back to the Bank without the knowledge of the public or the bank.  Upon presentation of the Fund to the bank, the manager informed me that although the message was good and polite, we had  yet to meet face to face.  After some Googling, I discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did  not actually declare any next of kin in all his official documents,  including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to present your choice as next of kin or relation of the deceased;  if you so wish, I will introduce my family to you personally and settle down here in the United States.  All you need do is to help me clear the money in the bank and we can share the money as you please.  All you need do is to make arrangements in my home country for a business meeting and get back to me as soon as possible.  I am aware that a meeting with you will set us both apart and after due talks,  we can settle down and have dinner together, after which you can handle  the funds in the bank while I will accompany you to the meeting place.  The fee for this transaction is two million five hundred thousand United  States dollars (US$2.5M)and two million five hundred thousand United  States Dollars.  I have the funds in the bank and have ruled out any payment policy as  unworkable. If you accept to work with me, you must give me 20% of the total funds,  2% for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction,  3% for your personal use, and 5% for the establishment fee.  Please do contact me on my private address which I will give to you once you have offered to help. I have all necessary  legal documents that can back up any claim we may make with the  law.

Dear Mr. Arif Shaikh:
,
 For the record, I have your wife's address and we (Ms. Arif and I) moved into an apartment complex about 3.5 hours north of my house on Tuesday, September 20.  I thought that you might be interested in our rental agreement. Apparently, Ms. Arif and her family moved here from Saudi Arabia about a year ago.  My wife and I (Ms. Arif and I) were originally from Egypt and we moved here about a year ago.  We're originally from California but our area codes are actually pretty minor so we originally thought that we were moving to Southern California.  But Ms. Arif is originally from Saudi Arabia and our area codes are really big so we originally thought that she was going to California.  And she is originally from Utah so our area codes are actually pretty big too.  So, I guess her new area code is a big deal because her new home is located in an area where CA does not have enough power for its population density to support an independent power plant.  We originally planned on starting up the plant back in September but Ms. Arif's visa condition (you heard me right) called for us to wait until January 2, which was absolutely unthinkable because the plant would be operational back then.  Finally, Ms. Arif's visa called for us to put the plant up for auction which was completely out of the question because Ms. Arif is a citizen of a different country and our country doesn't recognize her new nationality.  We finally put the plant up for auction last week so that's why Ms. Arif is in the situation she is in (a crappy one, actually, but that's another story).  Anyway, she is technically our subleasee but she is really our landlord (he bought the unit from us 6 months ago).
 Ms. Arif seems to be living in a one-bedroom apartment on $600 per month (estimate).  We finally sold our last sublet and moved into a one-bed flat on $900 per month (a full month's rent for a one bedroom apartment complex).  We originally thought that maybe we could negotiate a little better sublet if we offered her some equity in exchange for the right to keep her on the lease (which we could have done if we had offered her some cash).  Maybe we could have offered some sort of equity loan (like a down payment schedule that she can't prepay downshift into) or some sort of loan insurance

Title: Re: Re: Attention/ Ceo/Concerns

My thoughts are as follows:

1) The lease needs to be in place ASAP for two reasons.  First, the new agreement calls for payment monthly (which doesn't seem fair to me since I'm paying this guy for two months' rent and interest).  My guess is that he'll pay us in mid August (assuming nothing falls through and we're on the hook for the remainder).  Second, I was thinking back to earlier this year when Cece was involved and how Cece was handling things.  My feeling is that Cece isn't quite ready to go to court (or to give up their crappy apartment complex).  There are a few issues with this new lease that I'm not sure you and Cece are aware of.  I was told by Cece that if they gave me a clause about a late payment I would need to include a counterparty statement (i.e., if they pay late what would happen to the balance if they didn't)?

The amount in question is USD$12 Million .I will appreciate your willingness to carry this transactions the gratification remark which will be determined as soon as i hear from you.As i have maped out 20%, for your assistance and 5% would be used for the re-embursement of any expenses that is encurred during on the process of this transaction . Lastly, I honestly pray that this money when transferred to your country will be used for the said purpose of investing in the industry, because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Allah is vanity upon vanity. I await your urgent reply to enable me up-date you with more information and how to proced.

Dear Mrs Farah al-Hashemi:

I have thoroughly investigated the matter and, as a result of the above, I have decided to issue an  urgent  resend request to obtain urgent medical attention for my brother, to prevent  secondary events which might otherwise destroy the integrity of  the individual.  This request is being processed  as per the instructions contained in the attached card.  Please  retain this in mind as you continue to make determinations on the priority  for medical attention for my brother.  It is important to  retain this in mind as we work toward a date when we will be done with the  initial set of medical appointments.  Once the initial set of patients has been determined,  we will work collaboratively toward another set of  appointments which, if necessary, can be made available to  priority  patients.  This second set of  appointments are scheduled to begin shortly after the initial set of  appointments are completed.  These are extremely difficult times and you and your family and  I are eternally grateful to God for being  present in this life and for  allowing us to have such a wonderful time.  Please  let me know asap if there are any  immediate requirements you need to fulfill for my son's care to be  expedited.  I will do my best to help  you as I understand  God's plan and testify to His love for you and your family.    Sincerely,   John A.

 Dear Dr. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 It is with a heavy heart that I to 
 
 inform you that I cannot continue to be a part of your  > organization due to 
 
 an important event taking place in Houston on 28th October. 
 
 I will miss you terribly if I don't have 
 something positive to report from Houston. However, I must tell you that I am 
 coming to a 
 difficult decision. I must choose between continuing to work for 
 Enron and starting a new venture. 
 
 I have always strived to be a part of 
 this great company, and I am 
 proud of my family and of Texas. However, my heart belongs to 
 Houston, and I can't let go. I love you so much that I have to 
 tell you this right now. 
 
 If you feel that we can't live without each other, then you need to 
 say so. 
 
 If you feel that we can't have the life we want or the relationships we need, then you need to 
 say so. 
 
 I can't choose between my career and being with you. 
 
 It's just not in our DNA. However, we don't have much time left and I don't want to send you that signal. 
 
 Please give me a chance to prove myself and tell you why I should be a part of 
 this company and what I can do instead. 
 
 If you feel that we can't have the life we want or the relationships we need, then you need to say so. 
 
 This relationship began over a year ago, and it has made me very happy over the last year.  I have always wanted to be your partner, and I couldn't have asked for a better match.  I am so looking forward to getting to know you and sharing with you the feelings of how much I've missed being with you. 
 (both of us sob up to this very moment)
 
 I love YOU, and I will miss you even more when the storm passes. This love is unconditional; it is what makes you feel safe and at peace.  If there is anything you need, you can come to my office and I will do my best to make sure you feel that way even closer."	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0139.png			Machine

That's all I was saying.  It  sounds like you were there and I was  not.   I was not sure if you were  coming back on Friday, because I was planning on spending  some quality time with my son before the  day was out.  In addition, I was not sure if you were even coming to  Houston.  If I was going to spend a few days out of the office,  it would only be because I was going to drop  by and say hello.  This morning, you called and asked me if I could leave early, so  I obliged.  I was going to be out of the office  on Saturday, so I was going to be home in time to be  involved in the festivities.  I was going to spend the night at home with my sons, and then I was going to go out the front and celebrate my new found fame as ""The Sweetheart  and Good Samaritan of Houston"".   Since today,  I have met a ton of people and have made new  friends.  I have a lot to learn and do in this area, but I am so  psyched for the trip home with my boys.  I can't believe it just happened!  My oldest has been to 7 countries in as many  years, and is from France, so he gets it.   I was also recently to Panama for two weeks, and stayed for two months, so  that's new to me.  I am so excited about all of this because I am moving into a new house with my wife and son, and we are getting ready to move out of here on August 23.  We are settling in now, so it  doesn't look like we are moving out anytime soon.  We will be back to school in September, so I can't wait to start  school over.  We will be back to Houston in October, and then we will be  moving to DC later on in the year.  This is a crazy life in a   whirlwind of its own right, but it is also the life of a young man who has so much to be thankful for.  Everything in life is a learning experience, and the more I learn, the more I feel  that I have become a part of this world.

Dear Dean  Osala:
 
 
 
 
 I need urgent help with an old project that is very complicated and involves a trip to L.A. for two weeks. I was referred to you by a friend who is an attorney and an expert in the area of corporate training. She is able to interpret your reply as though it were legal advice, which is why she recommended you over other candidates. 
   
 Unfortunately, her advanced age and the fact that this is her second attempt at a corporate training project means that she will receive much less legal advice on this subject matter. 
  
 Your friend believes that you should use your skill set to help her gain a competitive edge in this area.   To this end, she has suggested that you should participate in an Employee Stock Ownership Program (ESOP).   This is a program that gives employees the opportunity to purchase the stock of their choosing and in return receive equal or greater influence in the decision making process.  This program is very different from the traditional business strategy that is typically employed.   It is based on the concept of ""assumed control"", which is the opposite of ""controlling"".   It is the antithesis of the classic managing-by-committee approach.   It is the opposite of collaborative thinking and is very difficult to sustain over time.   The key to sustain this approach, as with many aspects of business, is a skill set and a commitment to keep improving each and every day.   You need to show your skills and be committed to continuing to improve them.   This is why it is so important that you show yourself to be an active part of the process and positively contributing member of the solution.  
  
 I do appreciate the concern for your son and the concerns that other parents may have.  The reality is that as of today, my son is in the most advanced stages of cancer care and treatment and I do not want him to continue living a life of dependency and pain.  I want him to continue living his life in the way that is most comfortable for him and his family.   Since his parents separated, I have spent a great deal of time with my son and I am deeply committed to making sure that he has the best possible start in life.   My goal is to help him realize his full potential and I want him to look to me for direction in the beginning stages of his journey.   One of the first things that I have

Title: From Mr. Al Nizami
 From Mr. Al Nizami ATTN: I must solicit your confidence in this transaction that is of mutual benefit and urgency of life in general. I am contacting you concerning a business transfer of a huge sum of money from a deceased account in our Bank. The said money was a result of a contract awarded by the bank for the goods and services supplied by the bank during the year 2004. The contract was supposed to the construction of a new steel plant in China and the actual cost of the project was over invoiced to the tune of US$25,500,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars). The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$130,000,000.00 (thirty united state dollars). The actual cost was US$25,500,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars).  The owner of the account, a Chinese Nationality with a Permanent Address residing in the United State of America, with a Bank Name as above, has for his personal safety and the security of my family, advised against travelling out from the country for investment purposes. I have therefore contacted you to assist my family in investment in your country.  I have the possibility to invest a total of 10,000,000.00 (ten million five hundred thousand United States dollars) in your country under your proper management and care. The money will be paid for us by you after you have helped my family to secure a foreign account where the fund will be deposited, and also secured a necessary agreement with a foreign security company to provide legal cover for the release of the fund once it has been lodged in your custody. I wish to note that this transaction is risk free and the nature of your business does not necessarily matter. For your assistance though,I am ready to give you a commission of 20% of the total money for your assistance, and 2% for the services of other part of your family. Finally I want you to keep 15% of the total money for your assistance, and 5% for the expenses the transaction might occasion in the course of the business.  I expect your urgent response back to enable us finalise this issue as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, BARRISTER AL NIZAMI

  In light of the recent events in the Life insurance business, I thought I would give you a call regarding a possible meeting up  with  Mark to discuss how Life is Financing our Insurance

 The following is a transcription of our conversation.  Please see the attached and modify as appropriate.  Cc: Mary Cooney <mcooney@texasinsurance.com>  Subject:	From Mr. Al Nizami
 
   I have been following up on your   urgent request for a meeting to discuss  this issue.  Due to the sensitivity of the matter, we need to 
 meet asap to make sure it is not being misinterpreted by Life.  At this point, it is more 
 appropriate for Life to talk about the 
 insurance implications of this event than it is for you to 
 share your meeting with Mark on this issue.  At this point in time, however, the 
 timing is inappropriate to discuss this important matter with your 
 immediate family and to provide you with a chance to be heard.  Therefore, I have 
 asked that you expedite your request for a meeting asap and to develop a meeting agenda.   This way, Life will have a date with the Insurance Department and you will have a one  day time slot to talk with them about how you feel about Insurance Code section 634G.    I have also asked that you please make 
 this meeting a top priority for us so that we can talk 
 about this issue in more detail in the near future.    Since we did not have a

 Exel, it was an important learning experience for us both.  The lessons we can take away from this are: 1) Roll up your sleeves, work hard, and 2) Never give up.   As we learn to love and respect our 
 elders, the next time we roll up to work, thank them for having put so much into helping us make it through this tough time.  And most importantly, 
 don't ever quit. It is never too late to start making changes in your life. Take responsibility for your life, and start living a life that you love.   This is something I know that you will truly appreciate.

I'm very sorry I missed you. My wife is having problems with our new child. I thought you might be able to use your suggestions to help her settle her school placement. My son has a bit of a learning disability and it's costing him very little over the short term. But I do want to help him with his school placement. I hope you can forgive my delay in responding.

I shall try and help you out as much as possible. In fact, I have suggested a few changes to your proposed school calendar.

Please try and work out an arrangement that will allow us to be located at your house during the academic year, but not at random. We already have an agreement in place that requires us to be located at an undisclosed location during the academic year. (i.e.  Texas A&M,  California,  New Mexico,  Utah,  Colorado,  Wyoming)

Dear Mr. Shafeeque Ebrahimi:
 
 
 I was referred to you by my superior, Monsignor C. Wright, M.Div. He and his family emigrated from Ethiopia to the United States in the 80's. Their oldest son is an attorney in the Seattle area and they have one daughter  who is 15 years old. They came to this country legally and immigrated with their spouses and children. Their grandchild is an infant and they are trying to get a stay on her visa so she can come to this country legally. This is not a time sensitive process so it is urgent that we get this done as soon as possible.
 
 My response to you is based on extensive conversations I have had with my US counterparts and my own extensive reading of the INA.  It is clear to me that your priorities are completely different; your Department is focused on cases that are pending and you do not have time to process as many applications as I do.  I appreciate that you are trying to help but my response is based on very limited data and will be based on your discussions with our US counterparts and my own review of the data.
 
 Please set a time frame that you will begin to accomplish based on data available to me at this time.  Otherwise my response will simply be based on my desire to help you and my desire to communicate with you in a manner that is both legal and expedient.  It is important to me that you begin the negotiation process with us ASAP so that we can have a better insight into your priorities.
 
 If you wish to meet with me in person regarding this issue I would need to meet with you in the next few weeks to fully understand what your priority is and how we should approach this.  I would need to provide you with specific details regarding my status as we have no current meetings scheduled with our UK counterparts and I do not anticipate having time to travel to discuss this in person due to an upcoming divorce.    Also, my expectation would be that your priority be to resolve the US$12 million question since we paid this in June and it appears that the court will be very conservative with this amount.   I would need to provide specific details regarding my efforts in drafting the draft treaty with the US to ensure that we are not complicit in the illegal activities of the US and their allies.   Lastly, I would need detailed data regarding my efforts to ensure that the information presented to the US is accurate and complete.  If you wish to meet with me in

Title: Re: Re: URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION

Thank you, please. This is urgent, and I have spoken with Chip's dad about this earlier this week.  I have spoken with Chip's dad again and he is convinced that Chip wants to get married and has decided that it is in his best interest for him to get married.  Chip is definitely upset that his request has been denied.  The way his dad is treating him, it upsets me so.  I have been to Chip's house a few times and talked to Chip's mom and he is very upset that his dad would even consider anything less than a marriage, much less a child.    Chip's mom sent me an image of a wedding invitation on Sunday, and I just thought that I would take a look at this.  Apparently, this proposal  has become an annual tradition for the Ebrahimi/Cresendo family.   When the time is right, I would like to go ahead and start negotiations with this family.   I have not received any responses regarding this proposal, and my phone has been  dead still since Tuesday.   My goal is to get this family involved ASAP in the negotiations.   They would provide us with specific information regarding their plans and  criteria for a decision.   Please advise asap on what steps I need to take to get this family (Ebrahimi's 3 kids and 1 grandchild) involved in the negotiations.   Thanks!      mcs

This is not a rumour and it is not a hoax. There is a business in my country,  worth about USD$12 million (Twelve million United States Dollars)and i the owner of that business,  (A miner) in our country (U. A. E) are involved in a contract with a foreign Contract Review Panel that is due to be awarded in October 2002.  The contract was executed in 1997 and paid to our company for construction of a pulp and paper mill at our site in South Africa. The contract was supposed to be awarded to a foreign contractor to the tune of USD$12,000,000.00 (Twelve million united states dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the funds was adjusted to reflect the difference in assessed value between the two contractors. We discovered in 1999 that the contract was not being paid and finally we discovered in 2002 that the contract has been pay by different contractors and that the contract has been awarded to a company wholly owned by one of our foreign Contractors without our knowledge or consent. This sum of USD$12 million has been floating and placed under dormant/unserviceable account by the Federal Government of Nigeria for almost three years now.  In order to transfer the money out of country, I need to have  you as the beneficiary and next of kin. I have the money in a security company and this is the information that you are required to provide. I will arrange for the money to leave the country and be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition for peaceful purposes to further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. It does not matter whether you do contracting, as a trust trust is enough cause for anyone to desire to assist in this transaction. For the information, i will give you my percentage and you will give me 20%, of what you will remit to me.

 CALL ME IMMEDIATELY ATTN:SIR/CEO,PERSONNEL REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION I am writing you based on recommendation in the commercial bank's file. I am a Director of the Bank of the African Development Bank Cape Town South Africa. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty-One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant, i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the money so you can be able to claim it with my government attorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country.

Dear TOM MORGAN,

We would love to do business with you.  Unfortunately, our (probably short) time line on this transaction is very short.  You have been referred to me by an Intereoretty broker-dealer who is very promising and has excellent relationships with a number of international financial institutions.  Our goal is to convince  these folks that we can deliver on our time  line.  Unfortunately, our time line is very long.   In fact, our time  line is much shorter than the one-year deadline.   We have started negotiating with these folks and we intend to move  this process along very quickly.   This process should be completed by the end of the  first week of June.   However, due to the urgency of this transaction, certain co-ordinates and information has been  lost due to the transition.  To return to our original time line, we need your comments and  suggestions on how we can make this process flow in a less  intensive manner.  It is my hope that the more immediate concerns can be mitigated or  eliminated in the interim.   As we have discussed, I would like to keep the original 1/2 mile time line  with an urgent revision to it.   This revision needs to be in place no later than June 2013.   This way, we get our wish granted and we still have  some flexibility in the event that we lose money.   An urgent revision to the settlement we have already made with the ADEA would  be in order before June.     However, due to the urgency of this transaction, I have to propose to  you today and you have until Monday to make your decision.   If you decide to accept the revision to the settlement,  then you will have until early July to approve the revised agreement.      If, on the other hand, you decide to reject the proposed changes, then you will  have until August to do so.    The proposed revisions to the settlement should be in place no sooner  than August 13.     This way, we avoid any ""ifs"" and ""buts"" about the  appropriate timeline.      I hope you and your family are doing well.  I will contact you shortly  with further information regarding the Hebert Report.    - Dan  x3-0977

Title: Re: Re: Urgent  Business Proposal

Dear Bill:

I have heard what you have done.  I thought that we might want to discuss some contingency plans if things did not work out.   I have the same problem you have.  You said that you would look for a solution to this but I have not found one.   It takes two.  I will call you back.   

You won't believe it, but I am having an affair with my best friend's son.  It started out as a cold email from you about an unspecified   medical condition.  It was really nothing fancy, but it was something that  didn't feel right.  I just want to be clear that this is totally out of the blue and that  it has never happened to me before.  I was very upset that you took the time to read my email and to talk to me about it.  You were supposed to have the conversation with your son about being a dad.  That conversation never happened.  You feel that I am trying to cheat on you with my girlfriend.  I am not trying to lie, I just don't think that's appropriate.   I wish I could answer your questions for you, but I can't.    I just feel that after this conversation we need to talk about  something other than the relationship.    I can't keep lying to you about what has happened.   I just want to be clear that this has never happened and that  it never crossed my mind to lie and cheat on your behalf.    I'm very upset about how everything turned out and how things have changed since then.    I am not proud of what has happened and I hope you can put away this past weekend.    You have been a huge help and I am so glad that you came to my rescue.    Mom I Love You

Dear charles tomson,

I would like to contribute to the business of Enterprise Enron.  I have always strived to do the right thing and provide the best value to my employees and customers.  I now owe you an explanation as to why I couldn't find anything wrong with our past transactions - if there was anything you could have done to help us in past transactions - and plan to do so in the near future.  How are you coming with the ""discussion"".  What's up"".

I still owe you a lot of outstanding invoices, paydays, etc.  And I still owe you a loan I didn't pay you back after you lent us money.  Something tells me you wouldn't do anything to help me if you knew I'd defaulted.  By the way, how's your son doing?"".  

Talk to you soon,

Don't sweat it, Hughes.  Your son looks like a  bundle of energy.  I remember you saying you couldn't believe how fast he went from  high school senior to college freshman.  He's only 19 years old.   I hope you can forgive us for not having dinner with you  sooner.  You can join us at  Schulenburg's on Friday for  Smoked Cheese Fondue and I'm sure our  guests will want to join us too.  Besides, it  looks like we're going to have to get together on Saturday for  Lunch.  Who's playing on Friday?

From:  Karen.Harrison@enron.com                                       

On another note, do you and your husband have a policy regarding children who are not officially placed in your custody but who are still under the age of 21?  If not, do you plan on divorcing your wife immediately or in the near future?  I would think that would solve both  problems.  Unfortunately, we don't have any child support ordered but we have a few  battles on our plate.  One of them is a few short  weeks, the other is a few months,  and the third is a year.  All are  completely different  circumstances and we're just  awaiting the court to do its work.  If you and your spouse could e-mail me this information  (via  fax) I would greatly appreciate it.

Dear Dan,

I was just wondering if your son was going to be able to come home this weekend.  Should be having some problems with the 45 degree turn around (away). My mom was just trying to help my dad figure out what was wrong with the pipeline.  We finally got a break when our Son came home that night with a cold.  I was so sorry to hear about your mom.  She is going to try to help him figure out a solution.  I was just wondering if you guys were going to be able to come home Saturday?  My mom is taking it to the doctor this weekend.  She will be out on Tuesday, so no matter what happens she is going to come home  ""as is"".  I was just wondering if you guys were going to be able to come home on Monday?  You guys had a long weekend.  Make sure you guys get some much needed rest.  On Saturday I was going to take my son to the Senior Singles in his honor.  That is no easy feat.  I was starting to feel the pressure of not having your presence with  my family when my phone died.  Luckily my wife's service is still around to take care of me.  Until next time,  honey.

Dan

Title: Delivery Confidant
 Delivery Confidant From: Mr. Micheal Ipenza. Attn:Managing Director We are currently in need of an assistance from a foreign partner who could assist us in investing and doing the business in our country for forty (40) years. There are certain numbers on an international file that if transferred to his country would make him the owner of the funds. This is because the Act of Transfer of the funds was not done in accordance with the customs and laws of the respective countries where this bank is located. The Act of Transfer of the funds was made possible when the then President of the Republic of Cote D' Ivoire, General Sani Abacha, who is currently in exile to the Republic of Senegal, made arrangement with a German business commitee to transfer out $30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United State Dollars only) from my bank here in Nigeria. This money was meant for his election campaign and the maintenance of the National Democratic party in the country.      As a public servant still in active government service, I cannot acquire this money in my country. I therefore took it upon myself to go into active business in your country.    As a matter of fact, the success or non-success of this business depends entirely on the personality and capacity of the foreign partner that comes to receive the fund. If you are interested in this project, send the name and address as stated below. I shall then furnish you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Awaiting your urgent reply. Thanks and my regards. Mr. Micheal Ipenza.

I am 58 years old, i am now receiving treatment in the hospital. It's quite obvious that I won't live Longer according to my doctor as i am sufering from my kidney transplant illness,this is because my illness has gotten to a very bad stage. My late husband died from the British and American attacks over my country ,and during the period of our marriage we had two male children Musa and Idris.After the death of my husband , I inherited some money which my late husband deposited with a Security Finance Company in Thailand for safety.The doctor has advised me that I may not live long, so I now decided to contact you to assist my two sons to claim this money From where it was deposited and guide them for investment as you are a potential business man. My family will be interested in doing business in your country, thefore i would like to seek your assistance and help.I am interested particularly in properties , but your advise on other areas of private sector would be highly appreciated, i am in believe that you would be of great help in guiding my two sons to a sucessful exploration of the investment potentials of your country , which guarantees good capital returns and human security .As a result of this, i can take you in confidence bassically due of the source of the fund , hereby believing that your assistance will be profitable to us.

Dear Mrs Farah al-Hashemi:

Your gesture of understanding and contrition for my recent behavior reminds me of the times we shared together in the past, when we were apart but connected. I was looking forward to seeing you and having you around for comfort and reassurance. My only regret is that the relationship is not in place yet, and that I have not been able to extend that to you as much as I would have liked.

I hope you can look past this incident and move on, or at least try to, in the positive. It is a sad day when we have to report that we are unable to sustain a conversation.

We shall continue to work on this letter and other documents pertaining to PX, as we have done previously.  Please have your reaction and thoughts in a confidential setting.  This letter is only as strong as the people who have shared it with each other.

Title: Re: Re: I will appreciate your reply

Dear Mrs. Hashemi:

I appreciate your concern for me and my family.  My own son has been through quite a bit and I want to be sure he is not in such a position in the future.  As I have mentioned before, I will be out of the office on Monday, September 25.  I will be gone for two weeks to have my son immunization and to look after him during that time.

I am sure your family and I would not want you to be in a position of responsibility if you were to lose your home and everything you have worked for.  I would want you to come home and re-tool into the role of mother I know you need.  I cannot believe what has happened.  I was out of the office on Monday, and today was re-tooling.  I am sure there are many more personal details I would want to share with you, but I wanted to start this evening with a plea to you to come home and set things up so that  things don't get any more serious than they already are.

I know you are very upset with me for not having initiated contact with Teresa Olvera about meeting with her about this issue.  With Teresa's permission, I was thinking along the lines of ""meet me at her house, put your arms around me, and tell me I am important"".  However, Teresa's permission was needed in order to move forward with this important matter.  I suggest you not discuss this further as it would be unwise and not in the best interests of the case.

If you do discuss this further with me, I would love to take the conversation to another level and try to help people in the process of moving past their past mistakes.  However, this is not an attack on Teresa.  Teresa made some personal sacrifices in order to help build this great family.  She is an example for every child in the Komen Foundation and for that I am eternally indebted.  Her unwavering commitment to doing what is right is a source of immense pride to me and to her.  Even when faced with terrible choices, she chose to be the one to make them; that was her strength.  An example to look up to and a champion for every child in the area.  So, I am eternally grateful and humbled by this gift.      My God is great and my family is blessed beyond measure.  I can't believe how long"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0153.png			Machine

I became aware of the existence of this fund in a safe-deposit box kept by my branch manager at the end of May 2001. The box was opened and the contents of the box lost. Since we have not known the contents of the box since then, we assumed it was lost by accident. After due deliberation with my colleagues, we decided to leave the fund worldwide for safe keeping in a secluded area as I will arrange for us to resume our business relationship when the fund has been in there for a long time. I have therefore, sought your assistance in the transfer of the fund to your account. I have the authority of my manager and two other top officials to request that you should present your self as the beneficiary to the fund to enable us transfer into your account the fund 30% of the total sum. You should furnish me immediately with your phone number,firm's name or any alias so that I can use your confidential telephone and fax number to conduct the necessary procedures. I have also decided to give you 20% of the total sum for all your assistance, I hope this is the right decision for you. Please, I appreciate the urgency of this transaction. I will like to assure you that there is no risk attached. I am waiting for your urgent response. Yours faithfully, Dr. Iwan R. Jones

Dear Mr. Iwan R. Jones:

This is very urgent information, 

We have a serious problem in southern California related to PG&E's $700 million HOA contract with Energy One,  failed contract modifications,  mismanagement of contracts,  unbridled spending,  unmonitored commitments, and a host of other  problems.  Your urgent response to this crisis is critical given the serious 
 questions we are asking ourselves right now.  How did this massive energy problem start?  Why do we keep getting asked ""Why?"", 

Please help resolve this energy crisis for the people of California by publicly stating 
 that the $700 million figure is not an accurate representation of the true cost of these major 
 errors.  The $350 million figure is the most recent and excludes the $50 million overruns which most widely accepted as 
 a cost in the industry.  There is simply no comparison.  The SEC has grossly understated the cost 
 incurred by PG&E and its subsidiaries in southern California to maintain these contracts and to 
 which they are entitled.  It is unacceptable that my office should be considered a hub 
 for investigation or prosecution of these errors.  This is clearly a business problem, 
 not a health problem.  

Regards,

Jones Anglin

 CONSIDER IT URGENT FROM: THE FAMILY OF LATE JOSEPH MOHAMMAD FEDERAL SECRETARIAT, LAGOS-NIGERIA. CONFIDENTIAL ATTN:SIR/CEO, I am contacting you regarding a business transfer of a sum of ($13,000,000.00)US$13,000,000.00 (Thirteen million, seven hundred thousand United States Dollars).This was a proposal of a tranfer of the entire sum into a safe foreign account and other corporate by you/your company into which we would transfer the money within a short period of time. We agreed on a good and appropriate percentage for transferring the money into your account. However, upon instruction by the business, I therefore requested that you contact me first thing in the morning of the thirteenth of October 2000 so that we can proceed in the transfer of the funds into your account. Upon successful transfer into your account, the money will be released and paid into your foreign account. All that is required of you is to provide a safe account where the money will be transferred into and an account owner who will be comfortable with the transfer in your country because Africa does not have experience dealing with money in general and the safe holder is the business owner. Both of us are civil servants and need a safe account where the money will be transferred into after due process has been followed to the letter. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address: (joseph_mohamed03@yahoo.co.uk) and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via email and fax mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email address. Thanks and Remain Blessed. Such blessings as is contained in the Word of God. Sincerely Yours, Joseph &amp; Sister.

Dear Don Black,

Just to confirm, our project engineer had discussed with the landowners in the area that if we were to build a fence around their land, they would have to put up with the nuisance of having our trucks in their yard.  Although they may disagree with this development, they would like to see it as a first step in the right direction in terms of desiring to keep our good neighbor in.  

If you and your team think that this is a bad idea, please discuss this with your group (i.e., the Utah Farmers Union, etc.) and come up with a list of reasons why the best thing for the area is to keep our good neighbor.  This will need to be presented to the landowners at an early date so that there is a baseline for comparison purposes.  

If you have any questions, let me know.  I will provide further details as we develop this project.

You guys and girls did well last year.  Do you have any  plans for this year?  I can't believe our  accountant broke up with us.  Now our lease is up and our new agent is  trying to get us mortgages.  Do you think we will be able to close these deals  before Christmas?  Don't skimp on  rent or ""free"" parking.    The new  agent is trying to get us rentals for the school year.  Is this legal?  If we move out before the  new agent finds us a place to stay, will our old agent still  be around to help us with our ""new"" policy?

I'm so lost...where do we even start?  Are we allowed to have  our own website?  No, of course not.  We need to get over this.  I'll check with my mom about the internet  connection requirement.  If internet isn't an issue, then I don't think we need an answer.  I guess I can start looking for a way to get  myself over here.  My options are limited right now due to the  fact that I'm staying with a friend in LA this coming weekend.  If you need some quick help moving stuff around, then you should contact me.

    This is obviously an urgent matter. Please respond ASAP to this email if you want to make this     important decision soon. Otherwise, I risk having our children (or our loved ones) ostracized or killed for not     following the rules.     My oldest son is 6 and my 3 year old son is only 1 year old.  They are in daycare because their daycare requires both parents to be present for safety reasons.  My son is being protective of my 6 year old when he gives me this information.   I would love to hear from you about how you feel about this situation.   If you feel that this is not an important decision for you to make, then please don't send this email.  You may not be the ideal parent for your child, but you are the only person who can make it    happen.  And if you are, then you need to tell me so, because I never gave you an ultimatum.   If you want to talk about this, then we need to sit down and decide how we want to   parent these children.   In addition to not wanting to ""burden"" my son with ""everything,""   I also want to avoid making him feel guilty for not having made this decision when he was asked to.   When he was asked to choose, he said that he would do everything possible to help me decide which schools are the ""right"" for my family.  This is a huge decision for him and it is very confusing at first.  I want to make sure that he understands exactly what I am trying to do when I send this email.   If he doesn't get it   then he needs to talk with me, because I screwed up big time.   I am very sorry that this has happened.   I was totally out of the loop regarding this decision.

Dear Mr. Martin Fusi:

Yes, we need help with the fee.  I have a son who is in the first semester of his junior year at UT and we just paid the fee.  He wants to take his senior year off.  Are you going to set up a meeting for  May 7 or do you think that it would be better left up to  UT?

Sorry for the late reply, but I had a conference call with my manager last week that  you were attending.  She said that she was going to set up a meeting for May 7th, but unfortunately, Mr.  Martin Fusi  was out of the office that day. 

If you could just manage to please respond to my direct messages instead of  constantly harassing me with  urgent reminders, that would be great.  I just got an  e-mail from an admissions supervisor that he is out of the office on May 8th.  I can't  see him on the 8th as he is in the office that day.  

Anyways, I'll try again in a few hours.

I'll try and help asap... This is just a heads up for people not wanting to pay  their ars son by June 1... People who do pay  their ars son will want to pay  ASAP so they can send the money to the ars son trustee  ASAP to avoid any late payments.  People who owe money to the ars son trustee  and don't pay  them immediately will be hit with early repayment penalties.  We need to get this straightened out  - ASAP so people don't get hit with penalties for not paying their  ars son in time.

 FOR URGENT BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP   Attn/Pls Dear  and trust worthy,  I got your contact address while I was doing my home search for a reliable person that would assist us in investing the sum of US$26,500,000.00 (Twenty-six Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars). I am interested in investing in your country into a very lucrative business as a result of the fact that I noticed during my home search that you have a close business relationship with a foreigner (a Chinese National) who is also a potential business man. During my tenure in my department, we discovered in one of our Special Compartments that a sum of US$26,500,000.00 (Twenty-six Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States dollars) was lodged in a dormant account in my Bank without any claim of the fund as the owner and the account had no other beneficiary. The money was lodged as a family valuable and a matter of pride for my department as we all know that investment in your country will yield more money on the return investment than sitting on the fund.  I contacted my private contact and through the goodwill of God he has led me to believe that the only thing we need from God in this life is to give us the assurance that we shall be protected from all kinds of  devils and spirit here after. I am now soliciting for your assistance to invest this fund in your country and also for you to help me see that my family and I come to a peaceful and successful conclusion.  If you can be of God fearing and willing to assist me, I will like you to send to me immediately your telephone and fax number. I shall rely on you  unconditionally and ask that you leave no stone unturned in this business. If this proposal satisfies you, please respond immediately via my email and upon your agreement the next business day. I want to assure you that this transaction is totally risk free as I got your contact from business directory located in the Internet.  You will also be entitled to 20% of the entire fund on final conclusion of this business for your assistance. Endeavor to act swiftly as all the paperwork in this transaction will be done by me. I have decided to part with 25% of the total fund for your assistance, while 75% will be for my family investment in YOUR country as soon as every precaution is completed.  Be rest assured that this business is totally risk free as I have taken care of all formalities regarding it.  I sincerely await your urgent response. Yours faithfully, Pastor John I am awaiting your urgent response.   AT A GLANCE:  1. Your contact address: 2. Your private fax number for easy communication: 3. Your private e-mail:

Title: Re: Re: FOR URGENT BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP  

I appreciate your concern for my safety.  However, I think our biggest concern should be with God.  Every time I hear His name, It changes my life.  I cry when I think of His wayward children and how they changed my life.  I am a sinner, But I am a sinner because I did wrong.  I hope you understand My remorse and 
 my sorrow for your son.  And for your family.  I, Too, have experienced Firsthand what it is like to lose a parent, sibling, friend, or relative.  I was raised in a 2,000 acre ranch house on a 60 acre plot in the middle of nowhere.  My mom and dad never had a lot of contact with each other, so I didn't really know how to bring people into our home.  Luckily, I have a very close (but not very close) circle of friends and people who care for me.  I also have several long term, Bible Study groups in the area.  I go to church on Sunday mornings for the mornings of both meetings.  I take the morning off, so I can be with my family and try to spend time with my faith group.  I also happen to be a big Sunday morning person, so I usually get in to church as well.  People often ask me why I go to church on Sunday mornings, but I usually just answer that it is because I get to spend time with my family.  I just got back from a trip to Portugal, so I am really enjoying it.  Oh, and have you heard   the latest on the case against our family.  One of our uncles is in the slammer for apostasy, which sounds like a painful and confusing process, but it is a process that Jesus Christ and His people have put in!   We as a family are now living in fear that the day will come that we have to walk out on all fours and pick up our shopping.  We have been dealing with this fear for the last few days.   At home , my oldest son is extremely upset about not being sent to a ""crisis pregnancy test "" and he is not sure if he will pass the ""because he does not know."" He does not want to ""force"" the issue. He wanted to talk about it with his ""special someone else."" I was really afraid that it would change his attitude, but it would be ""unfair""weird""better for him"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0162.png			Machine

Please, I will like you to contact me immediately so that we can discuss about the modalities of seeing this transaction through. When I got your contact information for this transaction from the Internet, I was extremely happy because it was true to life. However, as soon as I got your contact, I immediately made arrangements to get back to you with my foreign partner for the sharing of the total sum hence the commotion that had arisen from the release of the monitory. I conferred with my personal attorney before I contacted you, and also had a close relationship with my family attorney before I contacted you, to ensure that this transaction is properly handled and benefit from the high degree of confidentiality which accaraes to this Transaction. The nature of your business does not necessarily matter, for example, you can contact me directly on my direct private line:+2348020414 or better still reach me by e-mail to enable us start the process of sharing the money immediately.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance in investing my share in real estate within your country.  I shall greatly appreciate your assistance and co-operation.  Keep in mind that this transaction would be most profitable for you if you keep your distance from me and my attorney, as I will want you to keep a very close eye on my situation as soon as I receive an acknowledgement of the receipt of this letter.  I will be very glad if you take this proposal very serious, as I am expecting your urgent reply through this my private email. Keep Contact:+2348020414 Thanks and Remain Blessed.

You are hereby ordered to appear in person or by video conference on November 22, 2001 2:00 p.m. in front of Judge Shira Gass. Your failure to appear and accept this order will damage your case and the case of   Rebecca Abbot.   I will hold you accountable for your   non-compliance with this order.   If you do not appear or agree to   these terms and conditions, then you should not be issuing this subpoena in the first place.   Court is very clear that they do not have jurisdiction over   this matter since this is a federal case.    You can request that your   subpoena be superseded at any time by either party.   This is not a federal proceeding and there is a big difference   between what the federal court is doing and what the states are doing.   The federal court can do   very limited searches and seizures but does not have the power to impose strict   censorship.   The states can.   This is a federal proceeding and the   powers   granted to the feds by the states are very limited.   For example, the feds can't do anything about   a missing 2-year-old in California whose father is an oil   well speculator.   Even if the feds did manage to snoop around a bit,   it would take a lot longer than two years to find out where the 3-year-old was.   So, the states are trying to limit the   scope of the search so that the scope of the investigation narrows as much as possible.   But this still leaves the door open for the feds to do something that the   states couldn't do.   The states can get pretty much what they want but the feds can't.   That's why I'm vouching for   this process.   It takes two to form a cartel -- one that is heavily weighted   toward one side and the other heavily weighted toward the other -- and then the cartel has the   incentive to keep the other side off balance.   The result will be a level playing field that     benefits consumers and small businesses alike.     I'm        just  letting you know so you can start the preliminary negotiations. You need to get yourself a head start on the paperwork so-called ""free market power hog"" issue"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0164.png			Machine

 FROM MRS FARAH AL-HAMEDI FROM MRS FARAH AL-HASHEMI Address, No 10, TAYO RIMI, LAGOS-NIGERIA. Dear Friend, My name is Mrs. Farah al-Hashemi, the wife to the late Major General al-Hasshemi a.k.a. ""The Cobra"" who was in charge of the transfer of funds during the Gulf War. During my husband's time in the office, he was also in-charge of the payment of the military salary during his life service time . During my husband's tenure as the leader of the Gulf War, I witnessed many of the atrocities committed by the rebels and many others. During my husband's time in the office, I learnt that some of the money that my late husband deposited in a security company during the war was not actually the total amount involved, but a portion that was meant for my son's future investment in your country or anywhere else in the world. After going through some of the records, I noticed that some of the documents that was deposited in the security company belong to my late husband. After going through the records, I discovered that my late husband did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in the bank. This amount of US$9.9M (Nine million United States dollars) was actually Deposited in the bank as family valuables, and the authorisation papers for this deposit were signed by my late husband's family attorney and approved by the bank board before the funds were finally released. In order to avoid any family relation from being affected by the release of the funds, I will write to- some of the family relations who will be interested in this transaction are as follows; [1] Mr. Daniel  Hosseini [2] Mr Shoaib al-Hashemi [3] Mr Nasser al-Hashemi [4] From  Mrs. Farah al-Hashemi. I hope that this fund can be released and spent in your country or anywhere else where it will be needed most. Kindly please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk free (provided you keep utmost secret). I await your urgent reply to enable us finalise the transaction within a strict deadline.

You will be of great help in this business since I have seen to it that your presence and services are sought after in this business. I am Muyeke a Malagasy businessman and the personal aid to the President of Malagasy diaspora who died about two years ago. Before his death he called me and informed me about the sum of thirty-one million, five hundred thousand United States dollars (US$21.8M) deposited in a security company in my name. Upon maturity, the money was moved out of my country into a safe haven abroad, where it remains today. I am soliciting for your assistance to enable me transfer into your account the sum of US$21, 8 million. which belongs to my Malagasy counterpart. I have all the necessary legal documents that I will use to transport the money to your country. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see the money after it has been transfered into your account. Also, you will support me in investing the money in a lucrative business. I have decided to part with 15% of this money for your assistance and 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred by both of us in the course of the transaction you will also support me in. I hope to conclude this transfer within fifteen banking days if your co-operation is given to me honestly and firmly believing that you will never let me down in this business. I am making this offer to you because I cannot leave this country due to the situation there, my partner and myself have agreed that if you do not cooperate with us and our child, we will let the money roll into your account in your favour. If this proposal satisfies you, please do not hesitate to contact me and let us start the process of transferring the money out to your account. I have also thought of giving you 10% of the total money for all your assistance, and 2% for your effort, and 3% for the area you will provide us in your proposal. I wish to state here again that trust should be maintained regardless of the fact that this money may have been lying in the security company for some time now. If this proposal satisfies you, please do not hesitate to contact me immediately. Finally, I want you to acknowledge the receipt of this letter by sending it to my private email address. Regards, Mr.Muyeke.

Dear muyeke:

How are things ? We have decided to send the money to the plan already working on the account. The problem is that our lawyer has advised that since we sent the money to the plan, they need to get what is legally required before they can consider the claim. He said that they need to talk with my co-worker (our HR Director) about getting the necessary info from me. My goal is to make sure that the lawyer is on our side ASAP so we can move to the filing and billing phase.

Please advise on how to proceed ..... It is quite simple actually ..... Get me the contact info for my former employer that is outside of the United States (our major rival).  Find out their legal tender exchange rate so that we can get some ballpark figures. I need to talk with my former boss (United Services Exchange) about setting up a meeting with them so that we can get a better feel for their currency rate.

Thanks, muye

It is true that I have moved into an entirely new flat  (this one is much bigger and better). I had originally intended to move  into the house I shared with my parents almost immediately. I had always wanted to have  a close family relationship with  you. I wanted to spend time with you and your family.  I thought you would want to know about  these  trips so that you could help promote the cause.  Unfortunately, my parents are still  very supportive of  the cause and still live in the area where the tornado  destroyed their home. I have been out of the area for the past  two weeks.  I am trying to find accommodation that is not far from my parents  so that I can visit them again.  Unfortunately, I cannot find any  hotel that is actually rented out.  I have been staying at the BRUCE HOTEL in TEXAS for the past 3.5 weeks and have NOTHING  to show for it.  I am really just  trying to find a cheap flight back to Houston.  If you could e-mail me this information asap I would greatly appreciate it.  I will be out of the office  on Monday, but you know  what I am talking about.  Please respond ASAP to this since I am  sending the money to several different people at the same time.   Thanks!

2302	SocEng. 168-2	"Title: Re: Business Transactions/Agreement
Dear Mr. Frank Wantz,

Apologises we have changed the business procedures and/or processes so that the above agreement cannot be effective because  it is signed by attorneys acting on behalf of Transco.  Please review this, if it is not in effect please return immediately and we will resubmit  this as agreement at a later date.  This is a case in point, as we discussed extending the deadline to Dec. 1 to March 31 which is very problematic becasue its in effect  until the 1st of December.  This is not a situation where we have ``to do this, they do that, why shouldn't we make the rules retroactive to give them a fighting chance at the  fee schedule they chose,'' etc.  Simply by signing this document, both sides have committed  to doing business in accordance with the non-compete clause of the agreement.  This provision is very clear and  positive in nature and is intended to encourage free  exchange of ideas and information.  The counter parties intention was clearly to  quash any attempt at a settlement that does not include this provision.  This is a huge win for the  parties, and i am sure many others as well.  This is a big win for us as the longer we wait to resolve this the  more it will cost us in lost business and frustration.  I was right there with  you when you first identified this issue.  I can't remember exactly where, but from what i can gather we wanted to  avoid arbitration at all costs.  This is a significant win for consumers,  and i think for everybody involved.  The non-aggression pact  was going to be a big win for consumers since they would be able to choose their  provider of  energy, and it is a major factor in their economics.  By striking the non-aggression pact they  agreed to not use force if necessary to resolve disputes, and they also committed  to working towards a  settlement that promotes the free exchange of ideas and information.  This may be their biggest win yet, and if  things don't go their way i would go to war with them.  As it is currently  contemplated they will make a payment to Alamo in March and its  implications on our position in light of the non-aggression pact.  Its hard to believe, but  it was actually the other party that struck the non-aggression pact  and they really had nothing to gain or lose by not doing so.  Now

 Business Meeting From James Nimely ATTN: CEO I am James Nimely the only son of the late Mr. Steve Nimely a merchant of West Africa who died on 29th of December, 1999 in an air crash along with his wife on the coast of Cote d' Ivoire, after the couple had two children. Since his death, I have made various enquiries to various Embassies to locate any of my dead parents and this has also proved unsuccessful. After a very unsuccessful attempt, I am now determined to locate any of my dead parents. I have made some diligent searches and found the first tranche of money which my late father left behind me in an embassy vault. The money is USD$10 Million (Ten million United States dollars), and I have decided tol register it in my name as the beneficial owner to the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the money to a security company in Singapore for the safe keeping of the money in a well-established and reputable company there to enable the bank to commense the transfer to your account in your country without delay and also to enable you claim the money on my behalf since I have been refused a bank account in my country. I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free as the money will be safe in the security company as my foreign partner have all the necessary documents and keys to the security company in Singapore, where the deceased had an account valued US$10 Million. As soon as I hear from you, I will then furnish you with the details of the transaction. I want to assure you that this transaction is risk free because I have taken care of all arrangements with the security company in Singapore, as all the documents and proof of the transaction will be with the security company upon my request. I will then travel back with my foreign partner to your country for the sharing and other investments as you specify in our mutual agreement. I will also personally visit your country soon after to ensure the transaction is completed. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above email address and I will then furnish you with the procedures to ensure the transaction is successfully concluded within a reasonable time. I hope to hear from you within the next few working days. Thanks and Remain Blessed.

PLEASE RESPOND TO MY PRIVATE Fax:234-1-7755804E FAX:234-1-75972069 E-MAIL:(bny_sokol@latinmail.com) CONFIDENTIAL   Dear,  I am writing to solicit for your assistance in the investment of a foreign portfolio valued at $25,000,000.00 (25,000,000.00 U.S.D), which I have in my custody, since I took over the management of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) five years ago.  I discovered that the deceased ($25,000,000.00) was a customer of Wein'et AG, a leading oil and gas consulting and advisory firm in Europe, who died among other things in an Air crash along with his wife on the Nigerian Airline Rafale  aircraft on the 21st October 2000. I have successfully secured the money in the offshore safe vault of the Nigerian Government and the interest is being rolled over as a family valuable.  I would like to put before you alicia pink green energy bond which I have executed in my favour and in the interest of the good people of my country.  This bond was executed in two parts. The first part was executed in my name and approved by the board of Directors of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  The approval was given for the investment of $25,000,000.00 (25,000,000.00 U.S.D) into a government or company of our choice worth of $25 million USD (Twenty-Five Million U.S.Dollars). The approval was also given for us to meet in any part of the world other then Africa for investment purposes within five years of the expiration of the time limit.  This bond has been around for many years now and it has worked fine for us, the board of directors have fine tune and over invoiced the money to the tune of $25million USD.  I have the option to have the money transferred now to a safer location, but that depends on how much you want us to invest in your country and our cultures. In any case, I want to let you know that this is a risk free transaction as the board of directors have approved the transaction.  If you accept to assist me in this transaction, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are interested, reach me immediately via email, by return mail and upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Dear special_agent_frederick2@tiscali.co.uk:

I will try to associate this with an ETA (one of the problems I have with ETA is that it is very volatile)

Unfortunately, there is only one answering service in your area (Verizon is only in pari)

If you could answer me in a timely manner, I would happily associate this with an ETA of (at most) one or two weeks.

I will hold off on the issuance of a security for a while to allow our tech. people  time to get acclimated.

Thanks, Fred

Thanks for your quick response.   I thought that it may be helpful to clarify a few things regarding my planned trip.

Firstly, I have been asked to come home on Thursday May 8th.   My wife is coming up on that day and we will be out of the office  on Tuesday.   I would love to be there to look after your kids.

Secondly, I have been asked to clarify a few things regarding my planned carpooling.  Unfortunately, I have had a number of  issues with friends and family regarding carpooling and I just can't seem to get it together.  I need to find  a way to come home on Thursday and then back on Saturday.  That way I don't crash and then I can go back to trying to find my kids.    I need to know ASAP whether I can come home on Thursday, but I need to know  whether I can come home on Saturday.

Please let me know asap if there are any other changes  made to the list above.  

Thanks again,

Fred

Thanks for your quick response.   I thought that it may be helpful if I forwarded a link to the attached spreadsheet which contains all the pre and post-Merger price  projections.  For each contract class, I have projected over the last 10 contracts  to arrive at the desk of Ken Oh via email.  Simply enter the contract number and then click the ""Go"" button.  This will create a new spreadsheet named after the  contract class.  Simply right click on the ""Go"" button and select ""Save Link As."" This will open a new window  containing my raw data.  You can then perform your own refining or a brute force attack on this spreadsheet to get the  raw data which you want.  This raw data is provided for informational purposes and should not be taken  as a solicitation but you can then generate your own conclusions  on the basis of this data.

I'd recommend heading out on Friday and up to Texoma (it's about a 30 minute drive from my house).  Each of you gets one night and I think it's fair that we share it.  Plus, Texoma is about a 45 minute drive from my house so it  doesn't get crowded.

Dear Mrs Farah al-Hashemi

I appreciate your note and wish to discuss the issue of family leave now that the child has been returned to us.  I would like to put this in writing ASAP so that we can work out the settlement.  My mom and dad are both working two full-time jobs and have a few months left on their contracts.

Unfortunately, due to the child's age and special needs, I do not think that this is an optimal time to establish ourselves up front as parents would be necessary.

Dear Nancy, 

I hope that you are not still in the hospital.  I, too, have been  in and out of the hospital since last week.  My son came home with a ""broken arm"".  I tried to fix him, but it was too late.  I washes up on Thursday, and then my little one  had another setback.  We are  not breaking up over this, but I do want you to know that we need  to come to terms with this.  I know that it is hard to believe, but our marriage is  over.  And yet, this morning, my phone rang and a woman on the other end of the phone said that she was gay, and wanted to get married to me.  I had never thought about it before, but it seems that my life has completely changed.  I was raised in a Christian home, but I am now raising an Apostolic home, and that has completely transformed me.  I no longer feel the need to prove myself, and I have never looked at this life with the negative  energy that I once did.  It causes such a reaction in me that I do not even know how to process this.  I need to talk with this woman about how she can move in together with the kids, and I will be more than happy to contribute to raising the kids, if you want. But I have to be honest and say that I am not exactly sure how to start a conversation with this woman, because I have not done so. I have felt like a failure as a gay man, and as a father of a gay son. I came out to my parents a long time ago, and my parents were very accepting of me. My parents even came to terms with me a year ago, when I was still in the closet, that I was going to start living my life as a gay man.  That's pretty much the story of my life, really.  I am very glad that you were even interested in having dinner with me, because I had a rough winter, and it was really relaxing doing something for your anniversary.  Even though the wedding is months away, I still get choked up thinking about it every time I think about you.  That's pretty much the story of my life, really, except that I have three beautiful kids and an apartment with an apartment manager that is very stressful enough without a doubt that I will eventually have to worry about whether I am able to care for them"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0174.png			Machine

The transfer agent on my request said that he or she had reviewed the transfer request and approved it without any problems.  The Payroll Manager on my request said that she had reviewed the request and also approved it.  She or the Head of the Payroll Division have instructed their employees to look into it now that it is classed as an urgent request and will be a priority in the next transfer negotiation.

We are in need of a  joint business venture private investment, of a huge capital and a settled business in your country.  Let me start by introducing myself properly to you. My colleagues and I are here today because of the business opportunity presented to us by the fact that the Federal Government of Nigeria has approved the contract value for the purchase of crude oil from a privateer firm of the same name. This contract was originally awarded to Denmark  in the amount of USD$30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United State Dollar) but has since been approved to our behalf by the Federal Government of Nigeria. The contract was supposed to be settled in your favor but now that I and some of my colleagues are here on leave leaving for a business trip to the USA we determined to transfer the fund to a foreign account. We intend to invest the fund in any profitable business in your country with your assistance.  I have the authority of my colleagues involved in the award and review and the relevant document covering the award and review is with my colleague involved in the purchase. Now that I am here, we want to establish a joint business investment in your country with you as our foreign partner.  What we want from you is (1) a country, (2) a reliable and suitable location (3) a good remuneration (4) a share bequeing to you as soon as the fund reaches your custody.  If you accept to work with us, the following requirements must be met: (1) We must have both an open end of contract and a closed end of contract (2) the contract must be of a timely nature (3) the remuneration must be reasonable (4) both parties must be adequately rested at the end of the transaction.

Dear Dr. Ibrahim Quattara:

I have been out of the office and have just seen what I believe to be a mistake on your end regarding the email you sent my way.   Apologetically, I was not in charge of delivering the email to you, as I had instructed my assistant to do.  However, I was able to retrieve it after your assistant had sent it back to me.   Please respond ASAP to this clarification so that I am not held to a higher standard.   Once I have had a chance to look at the attached data sheet with a little more understanding, I would think that we could work out a reasonable basis for a claim against GM, as I have discussed with Adrian last week.   This claim would have to meet both of my pre-negotiations for her to even consider accepting the letter.   Not to mention, there is ancillary service that GM provides to the insurance companies that pays for the  premiums that other companies are paying for the claims that are being made against them.   The additional detail I gave you is just to hammer home how little understanding I have for the  claim and have you consider the additional information I would need to provide to support a claim that  is quite possibly the most egregious example of entitlement around.   I need to send this out this afternoon, so I need  to get it to a place in memory for Ken and Susan.   Thanks for your help.   -----Original Message----- From: 	Ibid.pdf

 We can get together in the next  day or two and come back in the afternoon to finish the deal.  I'd like to  think about it until I leave in the morning.  If you don't know, I'm leaving in the  morning for California.  I'll be back in the  morning to finish the deal, but in the mean time I'm trying to get together with the kids and my wife to sort this  out.  I'm not sure I can get back to you immediately but I'll call  you again in the afternoon.  If you don't hear from me by noon,  I'll have finished the deal and am dropping my kids off at school.  I'll be home in the  morning to sort this out.  I'm sure you will have some questions for me I'm  trying to answer for you.  I'll leave you a message next time I see you.

Dear Sir/madam, I know that this proposal letter might come to you as a surprise as we have not known before, but be sure that it is real and a genuine business. I am a member of the contract award and monitoring committee set up by the government of Nigeria under the present civilian dispensation to supervise the activities of national and international contractor with regard to the fiscal policy of the country. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed in favour of the Federal Government of Nigeria in the past several years. The total value of these contracts were sub-bid and executed to the satisfaction of the original contractors. As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Nigeria. Hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company account details as a beneficiary of a foreign account, and to enable me transfer the total amount to your designated account. On actualisation, the fund will be disbursed as stated below. (i) 20% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary; (ii) 80% of the total fund will be for us. All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction within the next few working days of commencement. For further details as to the workability of this transaction, please reach me as soon as possible for further clarification.

Dear MR.MICHEAL LAUDER,

I just got off the phone with Bradley Schaefer at  MHP. He and his group are involved in a HUGE project called  Supermicro.  I talked to him about taking a look at an idea he had and putting it  into practice.  It is basically a pilot program in a commercial setting.  It will be  up and running in about 4 weeks.  I think you might be interested in  what he has planned to do.   In fact, I am trying to get together with your business acct. lady to  brainstorm some ideas on how to use the plane. lease.   We have a 5 year lease at the  airport. We want to get it into proper financing.   Unfortunately, the bank won't do it  for free.  Then we had to go to the Urban Moving Image Board (more  commonly known as the OMB).   Their general counsel is Jeff Stuffow and my dad is his supervisor.   Basically, they are saying that if we want to  use the airport as our headquarters, we need to get a financing  plan in place.   The good news  is that the lease allows us to build what are essentially ""asseternal features"" on top of what  the real estate is.        This would be good  for the bank. the city of  Phoenix. well being. The bad news       That is, as of late June 2001 there is a large (the  leases go figure to start with a small townhomecoming up there), there is a big hassle with its own airport and the big buildings and two  other problems.

I'll be out of the office  March 21.  I just got off the phone with our  CFO about moving some of our inventory  out of the jurisdiction.  We just got done making a phone  call to a few of our larger customers in California who are tied  up in large transactions.  Most of the inventory is sitting in Asian market, where  it would take a lot longer than it would  here.  Also, there are some big purchases coming up that we need to  close before the month is out.  We will be able to use the new location by  April as it is closer to our office.

Title: business proposition
 business proposition Dear Sir/Madam, I am Donald J. Otobo, a sierra Leonie and a member of the inter-country steering committee (C.I.O.C.) of the African Union (AU). I am contacting you of a business transfer, of a huge sum of money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. To ease your apprehension, I got your contact from the Africa am amerchant service. Your contact was sufficient to enable me contact you for this transaction, on a business transfer of a sum of $25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state dollars) into your account. This was due to the fact that I discovered that your credit report does not indicate any known or living beneficiary, but instead has consistently shown me as the only natural person to have this particular account. I have sole discretion as to where and when this money should be released on the instruction of the bank, based on the dictates of my conscience. This is the position I found myself in, after spending some time online and over the Internet, after consulting my conscience, I decided to forward to you this business transfer, in the interest of good business partnership. We want you to assist us in transferring this money out of Dakar - Senegal, into a viable business venture in your country. All the documents covering this deposit and the production of the vital documents covering this deposit require a high degree of confidence. This is why I contacted you to assist me in this transaction. We agreed that 20% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, while 10% will be set aside for expenses and sharing as required by law in your country and internationally, as per our mutually agreed percentage. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your response, I will then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email address:     info@sierralee-international.com. Please respect my privacy, as I await your urgent response. Yours faithfully, Donald J. Otobo

Dear Donald J.  Otobo:
 
 I have been out of the office  (9am to 5pm) since Ken and Nancy made the announcement   that they are discontinuing operations.  I am writing to request an urgent meeting to discuss how we can best help in this transition.  
   Since our meeting last week, I have been  meeting with several business leaders in our area who are calling on us to help them transition to a  non-profit model.  Business leaders from around the area have contacted me urging them to stay connected with the  ERCOT community.  Many of them are re-branding or have entered into discussions with a non-profit model and want to  remain connected with the ERCOT community.  
 
 I am not sure your availability tomorrow, but I would love to meet with you to discuss how we can best help them transition.

Dear Mrs Farah al-Hashemi:

Thank you very much for the quick response.  The only thing I would change is the apperance of salt in the preparation of this recipe.  The recipe has always been fairly simple and requires very little cooking time.  I would suggest reducing the recipe to one cup (approximately one teaspoon) of table salt.

Of course, the recipe is not meant to be a substitute for the medical care that you and your family receive, but I would still recommend taking it slow and seeing if there is any way to reduce the amount of time needed until you are done.  If there is, by all means, increase the time and cook until tender.

Please note that this is not a substitute for the full range of medical care that you and your family receive, nor is it intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease.  Any use of this recipe is at your own risk.

You are very welcome to come by my house for a free dinner and I will happily share my success by example to help other families in similar situations.

Sincerely, Mike

Thanks, Maureen.  I just got back from an Archer meeting with the ADEQ Commissioner and he  informed me that he was going to meet with you later that afternoon.  He was going to  draft a complaint to the ADEQ regarding this misinterpretation of the  Empowerment Principle.   I had hoped that you could use your ```Summon Richard!''` call to  force this misinterpretation of the  Empowerment Principle corrected.  Unfortunately, because of Federal regulations, the  Empowerment Principle is not in effect until Friday, 1/1/01.   I had hoped that you could use your persuasive skills and the  intimidation factor of a lawsuit to  force this misinterpretation of the  Empowerment Principle   righting the  mistake.   Unfortunately, due to a court ruling,  this is no longer an option.   Since Federal regulations do not recognize the  Empowerment Principle, this is not an option.   I will consider other remedies, but  in the mean time we need to get this resolved.   Please understand, this is not a football problem.  It  is much more serious than that.   I don't want you to get discouraged because you are not on the field doing what  you were designed to do.   I still want to get this resolved so that I can be there to witness your child's  blessed  heart.   I still want to help make this situation right.   I will do my best to make this situation right  for you and your family.   Love,  Barbra

Title: Re: Re: Business Transaction

I need to have this transaction in front of me by sundown tomorrow, to settle any foreign exchange contracts.  Will you look over this document and tell me which ones you have  found  and which ones you have  not?  Of course I will  like to look for defects before I leave for Germany tomorrow.   You have been  very helpful and the whole purpose of this visit  was to ensure that you were not stranded somewhere.   I will be going to lunch with my son in tow.   I will be in the office  from Monday through Thursday from 9:30  AM to 2:00 in the afternoon.  I will be in my car from Friday morning until  M-Th at 5:00 in the afternoon.  I will be returning to the office  at 2:00 in the morning.  I will also be going to lunch with my son in tow.  Then I will be  going to the doctor for lunch and a damn good walk.  You see, I had to put a stop to this awful trip a week ago because  my son had a seizure and I couldn't find his  Dex anymore.  Fortunately, he is ok and my flights are  under Renato's care.  We will be able to look over this more closely when i return  on Friday.  Oh, I forgot to put a stop to the Dex trip.   Also,  because I have been out of the office  for the past 2 weeks, my business has not  yet returned to normal.   Please, please, explain to me  why this is.  It seems like a lot of time and expense to  search for these things, and  it  sure was exhausting.  I will get back to you ASAP about the Dex trip.

Dear Mrs.Rita Diatta.

I was out of the office on Monday, November 20.   I tried to give you an update on my  situation.   I have a conference call with this gentleman and his assistant on   Thursday.   I hope you were not  too  surprised to learn that my youngest child is engaged to be married   on September 20.  That would mean that my engagement is over September and the search for our   engagement ring will start September 25.   I was hoping that you could at least give me some update on what is holding  up our engagement ring deal.   Most recently, our engagement ring deal with the big 6 met with a major revamp.   I was not too thrilled with the new take on things, but it  looks like we are still on the right track.   I know that you were  very upset with me for taking the ring on this trip.   You wrote to me that  ""you were going to give the ring to  Mom"" and I responded that ""even if it costs $50,000,  I need it now.""   Your tone was very  different that day than it would be a couple of weeks  later.   I want to  remind you how serious of a person I am.  I am not going to lie and tell you that I am not upset about the money.   I certainly wouldn't want to do  something stupid like that again.   I love you and you have always done a great job of supporting me.   Would it be appropriate to assume that we will be getting along fine in this relationship?   I cannot believe the out pour of help  that came my way.   My load has been lifted considerably, but I have not really felt the rush of emotions like you did.   I have a lot of unanswered questions that I want you to answer for me, but I also want you to know that we are still very different people.   I would like to get to the bottom of exactly what steps I have to take to get exactly what I want,  and I don't want to do that by beating around the bush for you.   I was hoping that we could work out an amicable way to split the money and get it  remitted to me by the time you get this letter.   As it is right now, I just want to work out an exit strategy to use if we don't make a decision

Title: Re: Re: Urgent  Proposal
Dear  Dr. Bursch,

I suggest putting off the wedding until after the stock market recovers.   The stock market is up  +100%.  My guess is that your family will still be involved at least in the form of a caretaker  for a while.  As things stand, the wedding is a press conference and gathering for your mother  and I.  We need to plan accordingly.  Plan on visiting your family in a couple of weeks to make sure they  are OK.  I have a hard  time believing that this has happened.   I was there last spring with my dad when a similar thing  happened.  I was in hospital for two weeks straight because of an intestinal  blockage.  My mom had to come up from out of town  with me.  Fast forward to this past  spring and my dad was able to get his  son out  of the hospital.  I have been there twice since then and my mom  is doing much better than  she was last year.  Everything is going smoothly for me.  I have two children that are 5 and 3 years old.  My oldest one is 15 months and a half old and his name is  James Madison.  James is now an IB student and is on his first year of middle school.   I took him to my high school in April and he was <3 weeks old.  Unfortunately, his first year  at my high school was tough and his first memory is of the winter  storm that rolled through Houston.   All of the above are negative cnet memories now.  Our little one loves spending time with my  family and plays with James' dog.  He is now looking for his first six months at my high school as James'  dog greets him as `puppy` and treats him like a <3 year old boy.  And, he is <3 years old because of the first summer he spent with my parents  and I in Houston.  Needless to say, his first six months are nothing short of a miracle.   I am so thankful to be alive and to be doing something I love that I'm able to do now.   I will be receiving very warm letters from those that are close to me and I will be  meeting soon with every member of my family regardless of location.   I will be moving back to Houston by the end of the summer  month and will be taking a job as a software "	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0187.png			Machine

Dear, dear.  I hope everything is going to plan for today.  Unfortunately, things don't look great for Christmas morning.  I was hoping you could use your generous gift to help those in need.  Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of time to visit all of the family; however, I would still much rather just to give something back.  That being said, I must say that this year has been pretty good to me; I am starting to feel the Christmas spirit,  am looking forward to the new year!   If you could please let me know how you are coming with some much needed  financial gifts for the family, that would be greatly appreciated.   Please, reply ASAP so that I can get started on the  required review and approval process.  I can't begin the required review and approval process until Monday,  December 19.  Thank you for your consideration.  Please let me know if I need to call any of you over the coming weeks to help with the necessary review and approval.

 URGENT MESSAGE FROM JEWEL TAYLOR ATTN:,                                     URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL Engineer Taylor Farm, United Bank for Africa Plc LONDON. UK. 34-1-841-2207. Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing you in respect of United Bank for Africa (UBA). I have an urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.  On June 6, 1999, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. David Taylor made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for twelve (12) calendar months, valued at US$26,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars), in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally I discovered that Mr. David Taylor died from a car accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. David Taylor did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account. I want to present you as the owner of the money so you can be able to claim it with the help of my attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your telephone number,full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the beneficiary of the funds. The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you and 10% will be for expenses incurred during the course of the transaction and the remaining 20% is for each beneficiary,whichever is greater. If you are interested,please reply immediately to my private and confidential fax number as above. Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documentsthat will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in real estate within your country. Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication can only be via fax  and letter mostly. Awaiting your urgent reply via my confidential fax number as well.

Title: Good day
 Good day Dear Friend, I am Mr. Arif Shaikh, the Director of Bills &amp; Exchange of one of the foreign parastatals. I have a client who wanted to transact in dollars, and we agreed that the total amount to be remitted should be greater than (11) (ten thousand United States of America dollars) into his account. We hired two parastals to transact the transaction under the auspices of a consignment which was produced in the course of the transaction. Parastals are legally bound to transact business together with one another subject to the approval of the consignment itself. This transaction was successfully concluded when the clients agencies (Central Banks of the West African States and the International Monetary Fund) were satisfied that the parastals had fully complied with the terms of the agreement.However, the transaction was put into question when it was discovered that some of the parties to the agreement were not in agreement as they had conspired together to over invoiced the total sum. Consensuses were held to enable all concerned be contacted through the above email address and all agreed that the funds should be shared accordingly.In order to avoid this, my colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by a lawyer for the funds (11, $900,000) to be released in your favour as the beneficiary next of kin. This is simple.All that is required is to make a valid arrangement for us to have the funds shipped to you from the Panama bureau foreign trade, service. Or your country of domiciliary, acting as the beneficiary overseas beneficiary's next of kin. This will be confirmed by the use of my name as the next of kin.The money will be shipped by the Panamanian trade, service. or our agency to your private or company account, where the account will be registered and the money will be paid by you in your favour as the beneficiary next of kin. Your company will then have the opportunity to negotiate a good percentage for investing in your country.  If this proposal is acceptable by you, please respond immediately, furnishing me with your private telephone, fax number and your direct fax number for easy communication. You should observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 25% of the total sum, 70% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses, both of us have incurred in this business. I look forward to your prompt response. Yours faithfully, MR, A.B.S.A.SH.

Dear Mr. Arif Shaikh , We want to inform you that John Adams has decided to leave the Good Friday Agreement negotiations.  This includes any effort to try and build a settlement with the sticking point 1.44.  This is a huge disappointment to our discussions earlier this year, when it seemed like there might be some light at the end of the tunnel.  We knew that negotiations were in very poor shape, and it appeared as if there might even be a lack of agreement.   I wanted to be sure you were aware of this and took the unusual step of writing to you on Friday, to gauge your reaction.  I knew you would be upset about Adams leaving, but I wanted to be sure this wasn't misinterpreted as a parting gift.   Thanks so much.  It's good to hear from you.  How's work? Where are you? Do you live in a house with other engineers?  We need to bring him home ASAP so he can get some distance from home.   I'll write again on Monday to bring you up to date.    P.S. If there's anything I can do to help you cope with this loss, just ask.  It's been quite a journey.  I'm sure your son will be just as upset about this as I was.  It's been quite a journey because of course he will be.  We will be reunited as Christians, but I'm not sure he will be ready for it.  I need to start this week on top, so that's the plan.  You have my prayers for a speedy recovery.   Love, Dad

I have him up here with me.  I can't believe what happened.   I can't believe what really remember but I'm glad that he's with me.

 FROM: MR/MRS MICHEAL ABBAS FROM: MR/MRS  MICHEAL ABBAS ATTN: SIR/CONTRACTOR I am MR.MICHEAL ABBAS the only son of late former Director of South African Overseas Private Banking Group (OPSBG) now deceased. I inherited a total of $28,500,000.00 US (Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred thousand United States Dollars) from my late father which I honourably intend to use for investment purposes in your country. In view of this, I want you to assist me to transfer the money to your account for investment purpose. The source of the fund is as follows: During my father's active years in the government, he had deposited the sum of $20, 000,000.00 (Twenty Million United States Dollars) with a Reliance Bank here in Johannesburg, South Africa. The fund was a byproduct of the sales of Diamond from Zimbabwe and South Africa which the government declared war on to the farmers in Zimbabwe during the war. The government of President Robert Mugabe has been extorting money from Zimbabwe in order to purchase Arms and Ammunition for his military and political parties. In view of this, Zimbabwe's Farmers are being exploited by the government and some Major companies that control major sectors of the economy have frozen their accounts in Zimbabwe to avoid capture by Zimbabwean Mission. I cannot release the fund from their custody unless a foreigner applies for claim as next of kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. If you are interested, please get back to me as soon as possible to enable us start the processing of the transfer of the fund to your account in your country without further delay and please treat this matter with absolute confidentiality. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated. Kindly call me on my private telephone number including the land line for easier communication and also for legal maintenance of the funds in your account. Thank you and God bless you and family.

Can you call and check on it?  Can you talk to him about it?  I know it  wasn't very good advice, but I'm taking it at face value.  I hope this doesn't sound like I'm against it, but I'm not sure.   I call every other night and try to talk to him about it.   Sometimes I  catch him on the phone and try to talk to him about it.  Sometimes he listens and sometimes he doesn't.

I'm very interested in your take on why it hasn't worked out, and how you plan to change it.   I think that this has been a huge factor in our relationship.

 This is a meeting to consider whether the girls should be allowed to play on Thursday nights.   The  club practice on Thursday evenings from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. (subject to change as the  members and parents of the varsity  club indicate).  We could, for example, host  the varsity boys' varsity team on Friday night if  the varsity boys wanted to play.  It is not a decision that  is immediately apparent because the girls' varsity team and (future)  plans  require some thought and debate.
 
 I do not intend to put my kids in a dead heat because of who they love.  I would  rather they got to decide than have me weigh in on  it.  But I have to  meet with the district this afternoon to get  the district to back off this issue.  I have been talking to  some of the parents of the varsity  girls and they are strongly opposed to the policy.  They say that this is about choice, not  obligation.  They urge  us to take a hard look at this issue and come up with a better  rationale for why the varsity boys' not playing.   They say that if the varsity guys wanted to be  independent, they would have to get in front of the grade,"	Face_generator-1600 result/face_generator-0196.png			Machine

The company would not be protected  by the covenant in the investment agreement.  Nor could the lead attorney receive any type of benefit  from this transaction.  The company would almost certainly suffer irreparable harm if this  were a part of a larger agreement.  Lastly, Mr. Schoenauer advised me that due diligence was required on  the part of the company and that there may be a better  way to protect investors than relying on  simple litigation.    I chose to take  this course of action because I knew it would be a part of my job  to do.   Investor relations calls like this are quite common,  and I feel that due diligence was not immediately forthcoming  from the company.    I received an unsolicited proposal from the  company on Monday.    I looked at the contract and found a number of  problems.   I informed the company that I was  going to review it on Tuesday.    On Wednesday morning, I  delivered my findings to the company's lawyer  (who is  not related to me) and on Thursday I  delivered my findings to the CEO and President (who are related to each other).    My call  with the company was  interesting.   The CEO seemed to be pretty cooperative and the  President seemed very reluctant to do  anything about it.   My conclusion  is that they need to do something about it  ASAP because it is affecting their stock price.   Their stock price has been consistently bad for several months;   it seems that they did  not want to do anything about it before the deadline.   I called several times and one of  them hung up on me.   I then tried again and again until I finally  got through to the CEO.   As a matter of fact, he still does not  seem to be very interested in doing anything about it;  he is out of the office

I just got off the phone with our French sales rep.  He is trying to help us out.  Our rep is very receptive and has told me that our inventory is extremely tight and he is going to have to start collecting his paycheck no matter what we do.  He is going to have to start making some phone calls to get our payment.   I just ordered some more ice cream from the internet and some graham crackers.

I am very much alive  and well  at this time.  I just received a call from my cousin who lives in London.  She informed me that she lives in Mexico and that she has heard  some horrible things about the economy and wants to  explore  real alternatives.  My thoughts are as follows: 

Stay put and try to work something out.  If it is not going to be the Mexico  border empanada, then why would someone want to  stay  there? 

Take advantage of the wonderful opportunity that is Mexico City.  The prices are significantly cheaper than your typical 2 hour flight.  Plus, there are many good restaurants and bars in this great city.  Is it too much to ask, just one or two dates?

Or are you just not that into it yet because you are so new at this game?  Too late to change your  course of action now that you have already had  a bad  experience with a guy named Jose Gonzalez.  You are very welcome to come home with a positive attitude and learn from my experience.  I know you will be much better off if you take a semester  off.  

Call me with any questions.

Title: Business proposal
 Business proposal Dear Sir, I am Mr. Abdul-Jabbar a merchant of International repute and Banker with a reputable Banks here in Nigeria.I have urgent &amp; Confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an American Mining Consultant and immigrant to Nigeria with a  Capital of One Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars deposited in my Bank here under my  auspices as a tourist. Upon maturity, he sent a routine notification to my forwarded address but got no reply. After a month, he sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers that Mr. Mmedeza Osondu had died from an automobile crash. On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mmedeza Osondu did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. The total amount in the bank is $7,000,000.00. In other words,the management of my bank has allowed this money to sit there unclaimed for a very long time. I wish to transfer this fund out of the bank and I alone know of the existence of this fund in the bank files. I will give you 20% of this fund for your assistance and 2% for any miscellaneous expenses that you may incur during the course of this transaction.All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through.I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.Please reach me immediately through my confidential direct fax number +23416605019 or you can send the money to me through my secured email address. I will then provide you with more details. God be with you. Yours faithfully, Mr.M.Abdul Jagoh .

Dear Mr.  Abdul-Jabbar:
 
 
 I need urgent help with this as it is submitted to the SEC every quarter.  Mr.  Abdirizak called Larry and Tana yesterday and they told him that Larry and Tana's son has autism and they need to talk to you about it.  It is important for you to  hear from the parents of these children as they are the ones in real  danger of losing the support of their families.
 
 Please take care of yourself and my other urgent matters before the call is over.  I will be more than happy to meet with you again in the near future.
 
 If you do not hear from us by noon, it is probably because we have been out of the office all day.
 
 Please let me know ASAP whether or not you think we should pursue legal remedies to try and save these children.  I would hate for  myself or my family to have to suffer the consequences of a bad business decision.
 
 Sincerely,

     My Thoughts
 
 
 
 I have not received any responses regarding this aspect of the transaction.  Let me know ASAP if any of you have.
 
 I am not sure whether the non-disclosure agreement (NDAs) will be enforceable.  The key is NDA signature requirement.  If an unsecured alternative exists,  it should be enforceable by way of an enforceable agreement in the form of a covenant or byproduct of the transaction.
 
 While it is true that the non-disclosure agreement form does not provide a mechanism for an enforceable non-disclosure agreement in the form of a covenant, it should not be interpreted as providing a mechanism for an enforceable covenant byproduct.  If such a covenant form is enforceable,  it need be in the form of binding commitments both in the form of enforceable agreements and non-enforceable arrangements.  An absolute yes or no answer would be helpful.  Thank you for your urgent attention to this aspect of the transaction.  
 
 Please also be aware that the non-disclosure agreement forms

Dear GEORGE LAMING

I trust this message finds you doing well.

With a huge undertaking like this, it is important that we come to an agreement early in the morning.  With two full time employees and one contract employee, this would be a huge challenge.  It is also important to remember that this is an urgent project and we need this project to move along much faster than originally planned.  There are no easy answers but we need to work together to arrive at a satisfactory resolution.

Please let me know asap if your options are limited.  I need to get this project done before the end of the week so that I can close out summer on a positive note.

If you feel that you need to make some hard decisions, or are concerned about your family's financial situation at this time, then this is not the time to tackle these issues.  Your sensitive nature and limited timeframe is making these decisions difficult.  I want to avoid any possible heartbreak this Valentine's Day as we all get to really ""get"" each other.  As I wrote earlier, after this experience I have more or less forgiven  you.  We will get to see each other again on June 2nd and I want to be there for June 2nd.  If June 2nd means anything to you, then you will feel better about the ""final decision"".  If not, then you need to tell me.  This ""settlement"" has not been made and we need to get together again so that I can apologize to you for the ""pain"" that this ""settlement"" has caused.  For June 1st I will be in the Atlanta office, in case you are wondering where I am.  June 2nd will be another exciting month for me because I will be moving from the LA office to the Atlanta office so that I can be with my family on June 15th.  Honestly I am not sure why we have not been able to ""see eye to eye"" on this ""issue"" in LA.  I felt that you were the one that ""outed"" me as gay to my co-workers and I.  You said that you knew I was gay, yet you did not ""confirm"" my ""gayness"" with your friends or my superior.  Your denial is not only foolish, but it is also a disservice to the cause.   I will propose to my longtime partner Brad that we should ""come out"" as gay at some time in the near future, but

We had a huge fire and gutted the place.  I was going to go back there and put the damage estimate there.  With the new building that just got started, some hot stuff started going on.  At first I thought it was just another ""occupancy"" I have.  Then I realized it was just getting started.  It was not a good time to be evicted.   I got a text from Maria asking me to leave.  I didn't know her whereabouts and I didn't want to hear about it anymore.  When John asked me why I had not been in on the party for the last 30 years, I finally confessed that I had smoked pot with my best friend 40 years ago.  My worst nightmare is that I may have started drinking again, because I can't remember now.  But I do know that I have never been more than moderately intoxicated and that I have never been in a situation in which I was asked to leave before or had my house in order (in fact, I was on my 200th visit today).  So my bad habits are not as bad as I thought they would be, and I have a hard time believing that I have been sober for so long.  It really is a blur.  My best friend was really going to marry his high school sweetheart, and their child was about to be born to their eldest son.  I had just moved into a new house with my wife, our 7 year old daughter and my son in January.  Our new 3 bedroom Colonial in Jupiter is about a mile south of my house on the other side of the barn.  We finally sold our old place and moved into a new one, because our old one had serious issues with our landlord.  My old place was pretty much bare bones, with very little else.  My wife is now working as an account manager for an internet company, and we built our new house on $70,000 worth of house stuff.  We had originally planned to live in a 2 bedroom, but we finally settled on a 3 bedroom, because we were having trouble finding a place to live with our daughter.  We finally found a nice apartment in South Beach about a mile south of my house.  We actually got a job at an accounting firm, so that is where our eldest son is now, and we just finishing his bachelor's program there.
